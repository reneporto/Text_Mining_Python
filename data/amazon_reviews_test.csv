negative,"I was going to give these seeds a 3-star rating until I realized, they're not good enough to order again. I'm sure I don't want them again so I'm closer to ""I don't like"" than ""OK"".<br /><br />The good:<br />The salt content IS pretty good. On par with how we season our own.<br />They're crisp.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Seeds are pretty small which means the ratio between seed and shell is not great.<br />Small seeds means you almost can't shell them, you HAVE to eat the shells.<br />Too many seeds have a sour taste which ruins the hole experience.<br />Per ounce they're more expensive than any others I've tried.<br /><br />I wish David's Seeds put out a lighter sea salt version. Their seeds are much larger so you can peel the shells if you want. They just have too much salt. I remember eating the Indian brand when I was a kid. They had a great tasting seed but unfortunately even more salt than Davids."
positive,"This is a nice smooth coffee, a part of the Keurig K-cup portfolio. This is labelled ""extra bold."" Not sure that that is the case. This has a nice smooth, albeit rather mild (and even bland) flavor.<br /><br />However, some K-cups have a harsh, almost acidic, quality to them and are not particularly pleasant. This produces a nice cup of coffee."
positive,I order this pearl sugar to make liege waffle.<br />I looked up other Belgian pearl sugar too but it was way to big granulate.<br />This sugar has just right size and amount for my waffle.<br />I definitely will order again later when I need it.
negative,"Used these in a waffle recipe that said they would dissolve and make air pockets that had some sweetness, resulting in a light, crispy waffle.  They did not dissolve but became burned clusters that got stuck to the waffle iron grids.  The waffles were like lead, were sickening sweet and basically the worst ones I've ever eaten.  I certainly would not recommend this Pearl Sugar to anyone."
positive,"Mayonnaise is an interesting product, cool, smooth and creamy it's the lush counter partner of the low cal mustard but it's of those things people think they don't like until they taste it in the proper way and that's all it takes for a secret love affair with luxe sauces  and recipes that can be made with it to start.<br /><br />I am a big fan of sandwiches and any new way I can spruce them up, especially with nice sauces and spices is always at the top of my new ideas to make for lunch or to fill into an interesting menu on the weekends. The Rouille is spicy, that I deducted just from looking at the angry orange color in the jar, the color of auburn harvest on a stormy night. The taste is of cream immersed in a sea of chili peppers and garlic with a peppery background. My favorite way to eat it is in a sandwich with a leftover cold coconut breaded chicken cutlet with some crisp romaine in between two toasted crusty slices of bread smeared on the inner sides with the Rouille spicy mayonnaise . The taste is a tropical rendition of a Caesar Chicken Sandwich I get at Hale and Hearty here in NYC but much easier since I made it at home and it took no effort.<br /><br />Great on bread, meat or as a condiment to any afternoon snack or smeared on some California roll for a spicy finish. There is no end to the amount of uses this product provides.<br /><br />- Kasia S."
positive,"Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it."
positive,"Well, that says it all...add some to anything as a thickener / tiny bit - works wonders.  Fast delivery from family run farm/store (nice folks) - average pricing."
negative,"Was very happy to find this at such a resonable price and I am sure it will a very good product.  The unfortunate part is they seem to charge shipping according to the price of an item, not the weight.  By the time you add up shipping and price of the xanthan gum you will pay the same anywhere.  Not a savings!"
positive,"The Xanthan Gum works great as a thickening agent when cooking hot meals or even smoothies in the blender.  It takes the place of corn starch or flour when I am making a stew.  I've tried buying this product at health food stores but could only find it on Amazon.  A tiny bit goes a long way, so even though the bag is small, it will last a long time."
positive,"I used this product to make my own lubricant, and it works wonders.  I'm not sure what else it's used for, but it makes great lube!"
positive,It works great for gluten free flour. I was able to make 100% Spelt bread because of this product. I can't complain.
negative,"I bought this online because it was much cheaper than in my local health-food store.  Then I got slapped with a $7 shipping charge!  For a teeny envelope of product!  I'll buy from the store, thanks."
negative,"This baby food was really thick and my baby wouldn't eat it.  Every other stage 2 food that I've gotten may have been a bit thicker, but this was really very thick, nearly the consistency of regular mashed potatoes, it also seemed very paste like.  All the other food I've gotten from Sprout has been fantastic!"
positive,"These are great tasting and while they aren't good for you per se, they are much healthier than most brands. They are fresh tasting and crunchy. My only complaint would be that the chips are small, not too many good sized ones in bag. The smaller 1.5oz bags were better as they stay fresher better. I will buy these again."
negative,"I ordered 3 bottles to give it an honest try because I didn't think one bottle would give me enough time to honestly review it. One bottle lasts approximately 15 days. I just opened up my 3rd bottle and I still haven't really noticed much of anything. The taste isn't too bad.<br /><br />The following comment is for the person who previously reviewed the product: I believe that what you were looking at was NOT the expiration date but rather the date it was made. I bought this product as well and was worried that I would have the same problem as you described until I realized that it had an expiry date as well as a production date. The production date was dated as ""something/something 2011."" And incidentally, the expiry date on my product was shown to be ""something/something 2013"" so that also prompts me to think that you probably looked at the wrong date and mistook 2011 for the expiry date."
negative,"I have been purchasing this product from GNC and love it--my appetite was curbed and I had more energy, but not the bad jittery type of energy.  The product I received from Amazon was rancid and it looks like the seal was glued back on.  I had a co-worker compare the taste of the product I purchased from GNC and the product I received from Amazon, just to be sure, and she agreed that there was definitely something wrong with the juice I received from Amazon.  If you've never tried this juice, I would suggest you first purchase a bottle from GNC so you know how it's supposed to taste."
negative,I was disappointed with this product. It arrived quickly but does not work for me. Feel it was a waste of money.
negative,"Anyone else have seasonal allergy type reactions? This stuff, for me, is hayfever allergies in a bottle.<br /><br />I performed a little test and here are all the details:<br /><br />- after taking it Monday twice each day, I thought I suddenly had caught a cold or developed seasonal allergies... I was REALLY bad Tuesday.  I had to resort to aspirin and Benadryl to get through the day. It was truly awful and I wanted to go home early for feeling so sick. Headache, itchy eyes, watery mouth, constantly stuffed and runny nose, tired...<br /><br />- After staying up quite late and finally falling asleep with the window open and the fan on, blowing in whatever pollen or cold air was outside, I woke up today (Wed) feeling totally fine. This is when I knew something was up. No cold or seasonal allergies disappears overnight with the window open and a fan on you.<br /><br />- So, I did an experiment today. I waited until halfway through the day (2pm) to take the first dose of African Bush Mango juice... the recommended dosage of 2 tbsp. A half hour after drinking this stuff, a mild headache came on, then within the next hour my eyes began itching and my throat felt scratchy and my mouth started feeling watery and, finally, I started sneezing and blowing my nose again.<br /><br />No doubt about it, this produces a seasonal allergy type reaction for me. Only other time ingesting anything ever did something like this was when I thought I would just go ahead and throw the beet stems in my juicer to be ""extra healthy."" I am not allergic to beets, but beet stems made my eyes run green snot. This stuff produces almost as bad a reaction. So... throwing away the full $18 bottle when I get home."
positive,"I started on this juice about 6 weeks ago with reservation. Did not think it would work, but have noticed a vast difference in fat loss. I take it with every meal consisting of balanced proteins, carbs and fats. Sometimes if I go overboard and overeat I definitely make sure I use it before I engage in a heavy meal.I now have a lot of loose body fat particularly around my waist and upper back area. I look forward to going to the gym to do my cardio and toning excercises to tighten up the loose skin. This juice has definitely made a difference in losing my ab fat. This was my most difficult area to lose. I am a size 10 at the top but wear a size 4 in skirts and pants. Obviously my most stubborn and difficult areas are my abs, back and upper body.I like the taste of this particular brand. I did try another brand but did not like the flavor as much as I like this one. That's the only reason I am able to continue using because the flavor is great. I will continue to use this brand until I reach my goal of fat loss. I've tried alot of products but this seems to be working the best for right now."
negative,IT helped me lose weight but it was expired it was 2010 and i purchased it not to long ago i could have gotten really sick!!!!
negative,I have been taking this for six weeks.  I have not lost any weight.  If I were you I would save my money.
positive,"I love the Flake Dipped (I used to live in England).  This is the best price I've found, and they arrived quickly.  I'll reorder soon!"
negative,"well, they are stated on line as chips then when order they are stixs, and I received expired food product expiration date Dec. 2012....great wonder what they would tasted like fresh.  Will not be ordering from Good Health agin."
positive,"I was expecting more nuts but this is mostly gel, in fact some pieces have no nuts at all--also a bit on the too-sweet side for me but if that is what you like then go for it."
positive,"If Amazon would get on the ball and offer this cereal with free shipping, I'd order it regularly!  It's the best gluten free hot cereal!  Reminds me of eating cream of wheat and malt-o-meal!  But if I have to pay for shipping, I'm better off buying it at the store.  Come on Amazon!!"
positive,"I don't have to eat a gluten free diet but I still like this!  It's a great way to consume a variety of whole grains. You can dress it up many different ways and it doesn't get old. We like it with a little peanut butter, agave nectar, and cinnamon! Yum! I'll try it soon with banana also  :  I don't usually pay good attention to the time but I'm pretty sure I usually undercook it some."
positive,"I love this stuff.  I would eat it even if I was not gluten free.  It is high in fiber, and low in calories, and tastes really good.  Something that is truly hard to find for those of us that don't consume gluten."
positive,"I agree with all the other positive reviews here.  I too discovered this blend from a single pouch offered as part of a selection at a restaurant.  It has the flavor of black tea without the acidity.  The notes of fruit offer just a hint of sweetness, and does not dominant the flavor, which I like (I'm not a fan of fruity herbal teas). After brewing, I mix this dark, rich tea with warm milk to make a tea latte for morning tea.  I don't think I could make this a blend I drink every day but I do enjoy having it around for variety."
positive,This tea is really wonderful but vary expensive in the stores.  It is still expensive buying from Amazon but less so than in the stores.  I will continue to purchase the African Nectar tea from Amazon--a less expensive addiction than wine.  Finding good herbal teas is a hobby of mine.  This one qualifies as one of the best.
positive,Very flavorful herbal tea. Just a hint of sweetness. It is my daily morning beverage. What more can I say?
positive,"I am a fan of mighty leaf teas and it is a good deal over here to buy three boxes,<br />I am happy with the purchase"
positive,"This tea is awesome.  Love it's smoothness... Reminds me of the smoothness of Asaam.  It's very light in taste and comforting without hints of bitterness.  I love it plain but when the mood strikes, I've added drops of honey, grated ginger or even lemon juice and peels.  My bro happened to have it at a fine restaurant several years ago and recommended I try it - been hooked ever since.  When friends come over and choose a non-caffeinated tea, they usually choose this one; even the ones who don't usually do teas.  So imagine my grin at finding this three-pack on Amazon.<br /><br />True story:  Gave this to a good friend a couple years ago whose mom is a tea connoisseur, highly selective of her loose-leaf brews and doesn't do tea bags.  I've heard it sung she rather enjoyed this Mighty Leaf... and ended up taking my friend's whole stash."
positive,"This is one of my favorite teas. Had it at a restaurant, bought some online, and I'm NOT dissappointed! You'll love it."
positive,"Although I'm not generally a tea drinker, I was introduced to this tea by a friend. Immediately I loved it. It has a fresh and fruity flavor that I find both refreshing and soothing at the same time. I drink it in the evenings because it contains no caffeine and it helps me to unwind after a long day. I highly recommend it for both it's taste and quality."
positive,"Enticingly fragrant and delicious, you will undoubtedly enjoy this pick -- the silk bags are biodegradable, and the leaf strength is often enough for me to reuse the bags three times and still enjoy the flavor!"
positive,"My family has been drinking this tea for a while, but I never really knew what it was all about. When I was offered a cup of this, I instantly fell in love with the rich flavor and aroma. The African Nectar is a great variety as well as the Green Tea Tropical. You will love this no matter how much you know about tea. Great, great product."
positive,"I was recently introduced to Green Mountain's Country Blend.  A friend sent me several flavored K-cups to try, and one of these was in the package. This coffee is hard to explain exactly. All I can say is they hit it on the head with it's name. It reminds me of a diner I ate breakfast at last time I was up in Vermont. The only way I can impart how this tastes and smells to you is to say that it's like Coffee Peoples Donut Shop coffee (my standard), but made with the mineral-rich water of Vermont, so it's VERY full-bodied. Like brewing it with Dasani bottled water, if that makes any sense to you. It's a VERY pleasing cup of coffee, but maybe not for everyone as it's a touch saltier (but not salty).<br /><br />If you don't like it, I'm sure you'll find someone on the K-Cup Exchange at Yahoo Groups who will trade it for something you do like, or will buy it from you at a fair price. It's an AWESOME K-Cup web site<br />H T T P  [...]"
positive,I brewed this in my B40 @ the 7.25 cup size. I drink my coffee with a liquid creamer and a sugar substitute; just so you will know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />I received this Kcup in a trade in our Yahoo group who had put together a nice variety pack. I keep a journal of all the Kcups I have tried and I found this to be very pleasant cup of coffee with low acidity little after taste and no bitterness. If I didn't have so many kcups right now I would purchase this wonderful blend.
negative,"Got 6 of this variety in a K-Cup Sampler and didn't like it.  I made 2 cups on the strongest setting (6oz.) and it tasted incredibly weak and watered down.  What flavor it did have was kinda strange.  It was sort of woody and mushroomy.  Love my k-cups, just not this one.  So far, the Timothy's Columbian has been my fav.  The Green Mountain Donut house is good as well."
negative,"You have to cut this down with Sprite Zero or water (Sprite Zero preferably), because it's SO strong - super limey and acidic.  Better than the Finest Call Carb conscious (which has sugar alcohol in it and makes you feel kinda sick), but not better tasting."
negative,"In principle a Splenda Margarita mix sounded like a great idea. The execution was terrible. I poured both of my two bottles down the drain. You would have to be pretty desparate, or otherwise never have had a decent margarita if this was your choice. I would rather skip altogether, as one of the other reviewers had suggested as well. The market has a long way to go to support less sugar in drinks."
negative,"I would be the first to applaud these products if they were good.  Unfortunately, I would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop.  There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.  You will also note that on their web site's ""fan club"" page, there are 0 entries.  Save your money unless you are totally desperate.  You'd be better off using Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit.  Now, that tastes pretty good mixed with Vodka."
positive,I'm not sure what the people expect who do not like this product.  I use this as well as the OTB 0 calorie mix you can buy at grocery store and I think they are both great.  I love the margarita but had all the calories.  Give it a try and you will not be sorry!
positive,"Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common.<br /><br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the ""English Breakfast"" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label."
positive,". . . you'll love this one. I fell in love with this black tea blend when I lived in Europe, and was disappointed when I returned to America that I couldn't buy it here. One taste of this smooth tea and you might change from coffee. It's the best cup of tea you'll ever drink."
negative,"This is a repeat of the same review I left for another Amazon listing for the same tea (but at a significantly different price).  Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT ""foil-wrapped for freshness"" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed."
positive,"The Lipton Yellow Label tea is a step above the ""regular"" Lipton sold here in the States. This is your basic, everyday black tea but it is much more flavorful and bolder than the Lipton variety sold in supermarkets here. It brews a good, bracing cup of tea. I recommend it over the supermarket variety any day. I have used this to make iced tea as well and while it's good over ice, it is best served hot."
positive,"I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan."
positive,"This is a brand of orange pekoe black tea that is drunk all over the world. Lipton sells it in many countries, and while the product might have the same smooth, almost inoffensive base note, to me the UK version tastes very different than the Indian version, which is perceptable stronger and has a more ""citrusy"" note. While it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas, it is distinctly better than the Lipton tea available in US supermarkets."
positive,"My wife loves this tea, so I was pleased to be able to order it for her so easily in North America. It arrived promptly, and in good condition."
negative,"The company did do a refund for the tea. It looks the same as the box that comes from London. However, it is produced in India and has a very strong, almost bitter taste."
positive,I first had this tea in Egypt.  It is so superior to the Lipton sold in the states that I was grateful to find a source online.
positive,"Discovered Yellow Label while on a trip to Japan.  I had arrived in Nagoya for a meeting, and had time to  wonder around a market...really just rubber-necking.<br /><br />I bought the familiar Lipton label as well as several other teas.  Yellow Label has a little more pronounced flavor than the US marketed Brisk Lipton tea.  If you are a tea drinker, you will probably enjoy the flavor. The worst part of brewing and drinking Yellow Label...trying to get rid of the box of US standard Lipton Brisk tea I already have sitting in the pantry."
positive,"I've been buying primarily whole leaf, oolong, pu'er, jasmine teas from a wholesale tea market in Beijing (Malian St). Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality."
positive,"After running out of my usual every-day tea, Trader Joe's brand of ""Irish Breakfast Tea,"" I found this Yellow Label first at my local Chinese supermarket in the tea aisle. I had only had the ""brisk"" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the ""brisk"" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea."
positive,"This is the perfect maple sugar candy...melts in your mouth. The price was also extremely fair. I would buy this again, and recommend it to my friends."
positive,"We like the pop-top lid on the canned foods eliminating the can opener wrestling match and test of dexterity. Opening the can of Artemis, one sees a solid dog food, light in color with bits of foods like carrots, peas, and potatoes readily visible.<br /><br />Our three pooches like Artemis and  their parents do also. The ingredient list is commendable with no fillers and none of those horrendous animal scraps found in cheaper dog foods. Mostly I like seeing the inclusion of potatoes in the mix. We like the density of the canned food; those runny canned products with high liquid content tend to dirty and stain the canine whiskers and beard. One user of Artemis commented that her dog had much less gas and fewer stools. I'll have to monitor our girls more closely to see if this is the case with them. I do notice a welcome firmness in Evie's stools though. If you're looking to try a premium pet food, give Artemis a try.<br /><br />More reasons to try Artemis -<br /><br />Natural DHA<br />Superior grade protein (human grade)<br />Multi protein source<br />Select vegetables and fruits<br />Custom vitamin and mineral package<br />Balanced level of omega 3 & 6<br />Probiotic/prebiotic<br />Skin and coat conditioners<br />Natural - contains no added chemicals, preservatives, artificial additives, or by-products.<br />No wheat or corn<br />Guarantee- Artemis guarantees your pet will thrive and be satisfied or 100% money back."
positive,"I have used this product for a long time as Lipton has always been a trusted brand.  I do go through A LOT of tea, so buying it on Amazon was quick, and more affordable then other stores."
positive,"My husband drinks a lot of green tea, and this is one of our preferred brands.  I also appreciate that the tea is naturally decaffeinated.  He drinks probably up to half a gallon of tea a day, and I appreciate that he doesn't have a large caffeine intake."
positive,"I am so happy I switched from coffee to Lipton Decaff Green Tea.<br />Coffee had been giving me an acid build up which is secreted through my skin, causing burning rashes.<br />Not that I don't love coffee, but the Lipton Decaff Green, of which I drink sometimes 2 pots a day,<br />causes no acid build up. So join the happy tea drinkers. GO GREEN!!!!<br />AMAZON HAS THE LOWEST PRICE ON THIS ITEM......BELIEVE IT!!!!"
positive,"Getting this product through Amazon has been a pleasure.  The pricing is better than typical retail and it's delivered to my front door free of charge.  I selected to get it sent to me once a month and I can still monitor it and make any changes if necessary.  Again, highly recommended."
positive,"I have tried other green teas, but always come back to Lipton as it has the taste I most prefer."
positive,"This is a good alternative to caffeine.  I like the taste of it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1QO"">Lipton Green Tea, Decaffeinated, Tea Bags, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
positive,"I work with fondant a lot and I use to buy just white then color it, but that takes a lot of time, is messy, and the colors always turn out different. I discovered Fondarific and I love it!! They have tons of different colors and different flavors. The taste of this is good, the only problem I have is the color is a little darker than I would have liked and when I mix it with white for a lighter purple color it looks more pinkish purple than true purple."
positive,"I absolutely love fodarific. This is the third one I've bought and I will continue to buy. It taste really good, and is so easy to work with! Definitely worth the money. Thanks!!"
negative,This product made my poor dog sick! I never seen her so sick before. I DO NOT recommend this product at all!
negative,"I had no idea that totally ""organic"" could mean totally ""tasteless."" The best thing that these can be used for is in cooking oriental dishes or making salads."
positive,Rich garlic flavor.  This is why I ordered it and I am not disappointed!  Generous amount provides enough to last awhile.
positive,This is the best mochi i have had so far! It was very fresh and tasted amazing and it shipped super fast!
negative,"I just received my shipment of this mochi yesterday and it tasted weird, not good at all. For clarification, I got the red bean and it comes with six in the package (I couldn't find anywhere how many were inside). I ate the first one, didn't like it, tried another and then threw the rest away. I'll stick to my Kohaku kind, just figured I would try out another brand now I know better."
negative,"I was disappointed because it was not like mochi that I have had (and enjoyed) in the past.  The rice cake and bean paste were of about the same consistency, and about equally sweet.  And it didn't have the nice flavor of either the rice cake or the bean paste."
positive,"I didn't get these to gross out my family or friends; just curious about the environmental and nutritional advantages Entomophagy.  These should eradicate the fear instilled into me by society and pesticide companies :-D<br /><br />I think I got an expired sampler pack because they tasted rancid and the added flavors are indistinguishable between each of the packs (bland).  There isn't an expiration date on any of the boxes so I don't know if dry crickets or the ingredients go bad after a while.<br /><br />Next on my list, worms :-)"
positive,"Just what it says and perfect for grossing out your 3rd graders! The flavors, though, leave something to be desired. But really, how flavorful do you really need your halloween prop to be? It was fine and good for the purpose I needed."
negative,"Even my 8 year old, who was super excited to eat bugs agrees.  These taste terrible, just disgusting.  Not even worth it for a kid who's happy to be eating bugs."
positive,"My son really loves these. He has been watching a lot of those survival tv shows where the need to eat bugs.  While they are way too expensive for what you get, it is quite a novelty gift."
positive,"Crystal Light Peach tea give me the type of drink I like and also the amount of water that I have to drink.  I do NOT like to drink water, so the crystal lite is the way to go..."
positive,"My dog has always loved these, but because they were cheaper and available at the local market - for a while I was buying her generic biscuits.  Well, it turns out the poor dog has major food allergies! Now these are all I get for her.  She knew best!<br /><br />I recommend this product because it is a larger size than anything I've seen available through pet stores."
positive,"I'm writing this review, however, if my dog could write it, or say it, she would positively rave about this treat! I have a 6-year-old Bichon Frise who loves these dog biscuits - or as she knows them, ""cookies""!  She loves the flavor of peanut butter, which is why I bought these originally to try. However, I was pleased to know that the other ingredients in these dog biscuits are oatmeal, eggs, apples and carrots and that everything is made natural. I want my dog to have good snacks (and food!) - and I want her to enjoy what she's eating, too. I have made my third purchase of this product as she loves them - she never hesitates to gobble the ""cookie"" quickly. She loves them and I know they're good for her - we're both happy! And to top it all off - the price is definitely right! I buy the mini-size as my dog is small. I highly recommend this high-quality dog treat!"
positive,My two Italian Greyhound puppies prefer Royal Canin Mini puppy which unfortunately is higher priced.<br />The quality is probably as good but just not their favorite.
negative,"My dog HATES this dog food. She turns her head away from it and refuses to even put it in her mouth. I bought a 1-lb bag at a local pet store(I thought they were treats) and she LOVED it. But they were not small bites. There is something different between the regular and small bites. The only difference mentioned on the labels is duck, but my dog loves duck. So, it must be something else. I don't know what it is, but my dog knows. I bought this 5 lb. bag as treats to sprinkle on her more nutritional mainstay brand or to hand feed because she loved the one from the pet store so much. But I'm not even going to bother with this stuff. I figure there has to be a reason why the dog hates it. So, bottom line, I got bagged."
negative,They were bad enough that I returned them. These are VERY expensive snacks. They should at least taste good. These tasted like they were old and stale. I don't recommend buying these. At lease not in the Island Mango flavor.
positive,What a delicious treat! These are the BEST cashews I have ever had in my life! I will be a repeat customer!
negative,"Received as a gift that I had researched/requested. Surprised that it contained 50% broken pieces (mostly tiny), where the photo online shows only whole nuts. Not recommended, unless you don't mind broken pieces."
positive,"Loved these cashews. Vacumm packed, whole and full of flavor. Will order again. Shared with others that love cashews and they also agreed."
positive,"Hugh.  Delicious.  Perfect for me.  Will buy again. Would make a great gift.  I had all whole cashews, no pieces."
positive,"I would have spent the big bucks to order top-rated Blue Buffalo, but was shocked to learn that there was a recent wholesale recall of Blue Buffalo products. Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious. My dogs love it! They seem much healthier since I've switched to this brand. The folks that sell this are wonderful. Canadae was shipped to me free of charge (Amazon Prime.) It was carefully packaged: no rips, tears, or leaks. I highly recommend."
positive,"We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food."
positive,My dogs have been on this food for three years and are doing very well.
positive,"This brand of dog food was recommended to us for our Black Lab, Sadie, as it is very healthy. She absolutely loves it, and her coat is very shiny. We can tell that this is good food, as she is very satisfied. Will definitely order this and possibly other flavors again."
positive,"Ingredient wise.... one of the best dog foods in the market. Of course, a bit on the expensive side. Our 3 dogs love this food."
positive,"I looked at.several diets for skin sensitive dogs.  Am already feeding a salmon diet and salmon oil bit wanted to mix.  The canidae has a good name, top ingredients and at time great price<br />Went to order another bag 1 mo later and price had changed by $6-$7 per bag.  Am now looking again."
positive,"My three dogs like it a lot, and my problem dogs skin has improved dramatically.<br />His hair his growing back and his skin is not red and itchy anymore. I'vebtried the ""Blue"" dogfood and it didn't work at all."
negative,"Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company."
positive,"Since using this product my dogs coat has improved soooooo much.  He loves it.  He does have fish breath, but his health is has improved."
positive,This product is made from the best ingredients.  My dog was allergic to chicken-based dog foods so my vet suggested salmon.  This is a quality salmon dog food without a strong fishy odor.
positive,"Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!"
positive,"Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down. How did we find out?  We realized that over time we have been mixing more treats in her food to get her to eat it  (This with only 2 meals a day!)<br /><br />Our dog definitely preferred lamb over the chicken, no more treat mix-in's, only pure dog-food!<br /><br />We = Canidae fans for life!"
negative,"I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats."
negative,"My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.<br />We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.<br />Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though."
negative,"Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible."
negative,"I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed."
negative,"This has given my young dog persistent loose stools. My older dog also had problems with loose stools on the adult formula, which was immediately rectified by a change to Innova. See the large number of serious complaints on the web about the new formulation before buying."
negative,"I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products.  Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae."
negative,"I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.  Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise.  Further feeding resulted in more problems.  We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGZ2L2"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a>"
positive,"Loved the taste, the smell, everything. Better than what I used to make myself years ago.<br /><br />And the BEST delivery from a second party shipper that I have ever received. Many thanks !<br /><br />Buy this applesauce, you will NOT be disappointed."
positive,"For colombian ground coffee lovers , this is a brand you will really love and you wont be sorry at all for purchasing it"
positive,"Community coffee is the best brand of coffee made.  Being from Louisiana and driving passed the Community coffee processing plant and smelling the coffee being roasted is an experience one never forgets.  I have drank this brand all of my adult life and there is none to compare with it.  I have drank all of the varieties of this brand and dark roast was my favorite until----i tried the Columbia Classico Blend and now at 62 i have a new favorite.  It has a sweeter taste than the other varieties, not quiet as strong as the dark roast, but strong enough to be ""real"" coffee.  I love it and so glad i tried it. Thanks Amazon for carring it and especially having it on a subscribe and save plan."
negative,I bought since it seemed like a great deal but when i made a batch it was awful. It had a weak taste and the aroma was as if it was old coffee. Completely disappointing i love trying all coffees and expected more from this. Will never buy again. I thought i would never have to say this but Dunkin Doughnuts is way superior so try that first. Seattle Best is a great coffee as well.
positive,Good price for Community Coffee pack of 3.  Received quickly.  Product packages were sealed but not firm bricks like I expected. I will say that the flavor was not compromised by that.  Will probably order these again.
negative,"Weak, dry, tasteless coffee.  Doesn't taste even remotely like it was made with Columbian Arabica beans.  The grind was also of very poor quality.<br /><br />How bad was it?  This stuff makes Folger's seem like premium, high grade stuff.  I have no earthly idea how people give this Community Colombian Classico such a high rating.  Perhaps I just got a bad batch of very old stuff from Amazon but I'll not be giving this coffee a second chance!  Probably one of the weakest and most tasteless coffee beans I've ever bought."
positive,"I don't know if the name ""Community Coffee"" is intended to convey a coffee for the masses, but that's kinda how I would rate it. It smells good when you open the package, you use a normal amount to brew, it has a good flavor & aroma. No disappointments, but nothing special. I have a hard time distinguishing this from other typical brands of columbian coffee . . . no worse, no better."
negative,"In my case, a half of the cans were smashed.  I'm not saying that the can was destroyed.  Also, it was within the expiration date.  However, foods in some of the cans were discolored...must be getting old.<br /><br />So technically speaking, there are nothing 'wrong' with them...  But made me keep wondering if they are safe.  So for a peace of mind, I decided not to order this product again."
negative,2 of the six cans were smashed when received - maybe they should pack them better for shipment or not send smashed cans
positive,"I recently purchased this item and tried my first cup last evening. A bit of an aftertaste sent me searching for the ingredients list, which is not on the individual cup but is on the original packaging. Sucralose is hiding in the ingredients, which, while not a big deal, is not a taste I enjoy. Prospective buyers should be aware of the presence of an artificial sweetener, which is not advertised or noted in any way in the product description on Amazon. (The manufacturer website notes that both natural and artificial sweeteners are used.) It's certainly something I'll be checking before making future purchases of this type of item. Overall flavor (except for the sweetener issue) is acceptable but don't look for rich, creamy body with this beverage."
negative,The Taste of this Chocolate almost made me pack up my Keurig and take it Back to the store! I purchased this Hot Cocoa out of excitement when I brought my Mr. Coffee Keurig on sale for Black Friday.  I am an avid hot cocoa drinker and this by far is the worst tasting chocolate in my opinion. It was watery and had an awful artificial sweetener aftertaste. Granted the first time I did not shake the K-cup as directed so I gave it a second try after shaking. Surprisingly it didn't do a d@mn thing to help the taste! On the bright side if you long for a watered down artificial sweetener as an after taste in a drink then this is the K-cup for you.
negative,Recently tried this milk chocolate k cup from Amazon. The only thing this drink has in common with chocolate is its color.Of the 13 items listed as ingredients  cocoa is number 8.It has a chemical smell and a chemical taste.If you buy this junk don't say you were not warned. It does not deserve ANY stars.
positive,"This is excellent hot chocolate, and I will buy this again<br />and recommend it highly.  Very good flavor, very smooth<br />and actually tastes like chocolate."
negative,Our family loves to have hot chocolate on a cold winter's day and this is not hot chocolate.  I don't know what it is.  You need to find another product for your Keurig if you are looking for hot chocolate.  Please do not waste your money on this product.  There is no quality control on this one.  How Keurig thinks this is good is beyond me.
negative,"Absolutely horrible, I have never had such terrible hot cocoa, very artificial taste .  It's going back!,  Waste of $13!"
negative,"The aftertaste from the artificial sweetener is terrible!  Waste of money, as the box makes no mention that it's full of nastiness.  Yuck yuck yuck. I can still taste the chemical aftertaste and it's been at least 30 minutes!  It tastes like I've sucked on a penny!<br />You've been warned.  I honestly don't understand the 4 & 5 star reviews... It's such a bitter, strong aftertaste!"
negative,"Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa for the Keurig is for the birds. I am truly sorry about this guys but it was nothing more than chocolate flavored water. This probably is not your fault since it is made with water. However, I can tell you that the very first company that can produce a hot chocolate made with water that actually tastes like a full bodied hot chocolate will be millionaires. Put a little body to the chocolate and you will have a true winner!"
positive,This was pleasant to drink and easy to prepare. I would have preferred a more chocolaty flavor.  Perhaps a thicker consistency would be an improvement.
negative,"As others have said, it has the chemical taste of artificial sweetener. When will these companies realize that there are a ton of consumers out there who do NOT like sugar substitutes!"
negative,"This was the first k-cup I tried out with my Keurig coffee maker, and while good it had a weird metallic aftertaste. At first I thought it was because the coffee maker was new, but i'm still getting that weird taste after many other brews later. If you don't have sensitive taste buds it's great, but if you do.. stick with the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate."
positive,"Wonderful hot cocoa! Great flavor, its very important to shake the cup before brewing and to use the right cup setting. Will definitely buy again!"
negative,"I found the taste way too sweet for me. I tried it with less water, more water, added creamer, still could not shake the taste. Very disappointing. Only used it at the office anyway so I am sticking with Swiss Miss packages for my hot chocolate fix."
negative,"Incredibly disappointed with this product. Tastes nothing like hot cocoa, just watered down. The sucralose gives it a chemical aftertaste."
negative,"I normally drink coffee in my keurig but I tried these for something different. They tasted almost like the weak hot chocolate you get out at an amusement park from a machine or something. I would not recommend them. I have a machine that lets you pick what size cup you want, small or medium and even on the small the hot chocolate is watery."
negative,I was really excited to try hot cocoa in the Keurig - but these are just awful.  We tried adding creamer but that didn't really help either.  Definitely won't be purchasing again!
negative,"I am a hot chocolate freak.  I was very anxious to try the varieties of hot chocolate with my new Keurig.  This cocoa was my first purchase.  It was so terrible I almost brought it back.  First, it took half the box to get the plastic taste out of the drink. A Keurig issue.  That last half of the box didn't redeem itself.  This cocoa tastes like flavored water, flavored with diet sugar.  It has the same aftertaste you would get with a diet soda or a sugar-free yogurt.  Also, you can't get more than 8 oz per cup. If you do, the taste just gets more watered down. A huge disappointment.  I will be trying other brands but my expectations are very low based on this first experience.<br /><br />I read a few reviews and learned that this product contains sucralose.  It is not listed as an ingredient.  Explains the diet taste plus I don't trust manufacturers who pull stunts like this.  The manufacturer is Green Mountain Coffee - very disappointing."
negative,"This is probably one of the worst hot chocolate brands I have ever purchased.  It is one of those things that has a ""something is wrong but I'm not exactly sure what"" kind of taste.  In some ways the flavor is like chocolate water.  In others it is more like carob. It just tastes fake.  I will not ever purchase this brand again."
negative,I agree with the other one-star reviews. It has a strange flavor unlike chocolate and more like chemicals. It's watery. I will try a different brand of hot chocolate or just use my personal K cup to put in my own hot chocolate mixes.
negative,"I'm not an avid coffee drinker, so when I bought my Keurig I really had my eye on the other drink types (teas, cocoas, hot cider.)  These was the first hot chocolate k cup, and I'm sorry to say that I don't like them at all.  The drink is watery, and has a strange after taste.  I hope one of the other hot chocolate k cups are better than this."
negative,"Don't waste your money! Garage sales this summer will be full of this crap. This is the worst hot cocoa I have ever tasted in my life. Tried it a second time ,thought I didn't make it right. Couldn't sleep all night & today I'm sick to my stomach. It is full of chemicals, not real food. Why would anyone want to waste there hard earned money on something that could possibly do you in!"
negative,Tastes like chocolate water with artificial sweetener.  Really not worth drinking.  The changes in formula necessary to make cocoa mix fit into the little cup really ruin it.
negative,"Thankfully this came in a variety pack, so I only had one.  But god, was it nasty.  I'd already been told by a family member not to go with the ""large"" setting on my Keurig, as it could make cocoa taste watery.  So I dutifully chose ""medium,"" and oh, how I wish watery were the problem.  It had such a horrible bitter taste that I at first thought my water had somehow been contaminated.  After reading other reviews here, I realize that it must be the sucralose.  I consider it not only very misleading advertisting for each cup not to be labeled as ""diet"" in some way, but sucralose also happens to be my least favorite of the major artificial sweeteners.  I don't know what the calorie count on these things would be, but if it happens to be low then I'd recommend trying this only if you're dieting and really desperate.  For people wanting a normal hot cocoa taste, avoid at all costs."
negative,"This product is very bland. I got it because my kids love hot chocolate, and usually they use my keurig just for hot water to mix their own hot chocolate. They were so excited to get this, but they didn't even drink their first cup of it because it has almost no chocolate flavor. I had to mix chocolate syrup in with it to give it any kind of flavor at all."
negative,"I got a bunch of these from a friend and wondered about the bad after taste. It wasn't like products completely flavored with Splenda (sucrolose) but it still a slight strange taste (I describe it as slimy) and left that after taste in my mouth. On the k-cup it self, it doesn't say it has artificial sweeteners or is diet, so I came to the internet and it is almost impossible to find the ingredients listed any where. The reviews were the confirmation at first. Too much Splenda makes me sick to my stomach so I know it is not good for me. Too much is more than a few tastes. Oh well, I guess I'll try the Grove Square or Swiss Mix as those are the only others I can find.<br /><br />I find the taste of this product unappealing and the after taste sickening."
negative,I made 6 oz cup of this and it tasted awful.  It lacked milk chocolate flavor and was very watered down.  I was very disappointed because hot cocoa was the main beverage I wanted to brew since I do not drink coffee.  This was very bad.
negative,"I tried the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa Keurig K-Cups and the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte. I like sweet things, but both of these are seriously way too sweet. The Chai Latte has a much more pronounced artificial sweetener flavor and aftertaste, but this too has the same artificial sweetener flavor. Not good at all."
negative,"We bought this KCUP because we wanted some hot cocoa around. It is completely watered down and lacks a lot of the chocolate flavor each time. If you like rich hot cocoa, this is not the hot cocoa for you."
positive,I bought these for the kids and they love them.  Since it comes out too hot for them we put two ice cubes in the coffee cup and brew the hot chocolate on the 4oz size cup right over the ice.  It comes out at the perfect temperature for kids.
positive,"With winter approaching I bought this as a trial.  I was concerned that it would taste watered down because I feel that many of the Keuring coffees taste that way; I like the extra bold varieties or Starbucks Italian Roast on my own K cup.<br /><br />I was actually rather pleasantly surprised as to how much like real hot cocoa it tasted.  Not watered down and not too sweet.  It's not gourmet but this winter, when you want a quick cup of hot cocoa after shoveling snow or playing outside, this will do nicely."
negative,This tastes terrible. Even the powdered hot cocoa mixes where you can pour hot water taste a lot better (and cheaper)!
negative,"Honestly, was not was what I was expecting when I ordered - it was bitter and tasted like splenda! Delivery was great, received order on time etc - but the product itself was disgusting - I couldn't even give it away at work! I left it in the break room at work and it went untouched!"
positive,"This is one of the best products for the K-cups system. The hot chocolate is just right, not too sweet, very rich and creamy and full bodied. I like that it does not have a sodium flavor like many instant hot chocolates do. Add a few drops of milk or 1/2 & 1/2 and it is awesome."
positive,"Back when I made my first cup (last year), it was indeed watery.  I thought how it would be nice if so much chocolate wasn't left in the k-cup after brewing (yes, I removed the foil, to recycle the cup).  I decided to shake the cup before inserting into the Keurig, and I'll remove it and re-insert after twisting it 180°, giving it another hole to brew from, which DOES help.  I prefer the taste of this to Swiss Miss or Nestle for sure.  I also add Vanilla or Irish Creme powdered CoffeeMate creamer which thickens it up a bit, or will add some Bailey's or Amaretto after shovelling show.  I like the Dark Chocolate version as well."
negative,"This tasted, watery and I used the smallest amount of water you can use with a k cup - 6 oz. The chocolate was flavorless but mostly it was just super weak.  I do not recommend."
negative,These plants looked dead and were very small.  I watered them as directed and they still look the same.  I've had them for a few weeks and follow the directions every time I water them.
negative,"I love these candies.... However, the entire case was ruined, not one piece was not damaged, obviously they had melted either prior or during shipping. The chocolate was stuck to the top of the paper they are wrapped in. . They were still edible, but didn't quite taste the same, the chocolate was gooey instead of solid, even days later when stored at room temperature. They really disappointed me :( So I am hoping the next case I purchase will be fresh, as I am ordering in October a cooler month, and hoping it was ruined in delivery and not the sellers storage."
positive,WAS GREAT HOW FAST THE PRODUCT GOT HERE.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A PRODUCT GET HERE THAT FAST.  WAS PLEASED TO HAVE THE CANDY HERE ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT HAD MELTED BUT WE ARE STILL EATING IT.  THANKS AGAIN FOR BRINGING BACK A MEMORY FROM WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS IN THE ARMY.
negative,"I purchased this tea at a retail store. I was terribly, terribly disappointed. It didn't taste bad...it tasted like nothing at all. I wasn't expecting a strong taste but the tea bags don't even smell like anything. Literally...nothing. They are the nice fabric-bag type tea bags. This was my first experience with this brand...maybe their other flavors are better."
positive,This product arrived in about three days.  Never use the entire packet for one recipe unless you like hot seasonings!  It is extremely hot.
positive,"This bread works perfect with soup or by itself. Really a wonderful, full flavored bread. I put the mix in my bread maker on the basic setting and then out came another hit from The Prepared Pantry!"
positive,"Thought that I was getting a gr8 deal when i ordered the 2000 pack for $44 from amazon...the order arrived in time and in good condition but while visiting a nearby costco in the following week of receiving the order, saw that the 1000 pack box was on regular price for $19 each....plus they have $3 - $5 coupons from time to time which could have brought it down to $16 - $17 per 1000 pack."
negative,"We've used Splenda and Kirkland brand sucralose packets. either product is very good for what it is, a no-calorie sweetener for hot or cold drinks, desserts, and breakfast cereal.<br />For convenience, rather than the best price, I purchased this 2000-packet box of real Splenda-brand from Amazon. After using the product for a few days, i noticed my wife replaced her normal morning ice coffee with diet soda. She couldn't stand the Splenda, it was giving her a dry mouth and bad taste. i had noticed something a little ""off"" but just dismissed it as my imagination. Later i tried a sample straight from the envelope, it had a very acrid taste and seemed to burn -- it certainly wasn't SWEET. i then did a blind taste test using a new, small box that i bought from a local grocery store. night and day difference.  in summary, i think i got either an old/expired box (there's no obvious expiration date on the box), or the product might have soaked up an odor/taste from something during transit."
negative,As I reported to Amazon previously the packaging was terrible. alot of loose sugar inside the box. When I opened the shipping carton My wife and I noticed the original Splenda box was not properly sealed. The Splenda box was literally unsealed and open. It made us leary to think that someone might have tampered with the shipment. As of today no harm has come. The sugar is the same. The quantity is wonderful. The price well I've seen it for less.
positive,"On this particular deal one gets the best artificial sweetener at the best price in a large quantity with exceedingly fast shipping, no reason to try another."
positive,"I do not live in the United States, and I am used of Splenda, and where I live nowadays, splenda is very expensive and not easy to find, and I found out that if I order it online from Amazon.com, I will get it much cheaper than where I live."
positive,No fancy box just great price. I had always purchased large amount of Splenda at wholesale club now I can buy it from Amazon at even better price with free shipping and no member fee.
positive,"being a type 11 diabetic i have to avoid sugar,<br />splenda was the reccommended choice at the hospital<br />and i am now completely sold on this product.<br />a REALLY great amazon value helps alot also"
positive,"Splenda is Splenda.  The quantity for the price was the sole reason for buying this product.  With Splenda packets, I go for the pricing.  I only use Splenda in my coffee."
positive,"when i turned 30 i cut sugar out of my diet purely as a health maintenance measure.  now in my 40's my blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol and blood sugar continue to be healthy for my age and height, despite being inactive.  so something has got to change if you want to stay healthy - lifestyle or diet, but preferable both if you can manage it.  i use about 20 Splenda packets per day in my beverages.  I have tried all other sweeteners for at least a week each, and while I'd like to support Stevia use - I just could not handle it's leafy taste even in my ice tea, which is already leafy.<br />i was concerned that may be too much since many web sights warn of aluminum buildup in your liver - so i contacted Cargill and tried to find out what amounts of Splenda did their human trails involve - but they would not tell me - only said there is no consumption limit.  that's why I took a star off my review - i wish Splenda's maker would be more forthcoming when a consumer contacts them with a legitimate concern.  if you can tolerate sugar, when making a gallon of beverage, add one tablespoon of sugar per 16 grams of Splenda, to soften the metallic taste of this sweetener."
positive,This was the best deal on Splenda that I've found.  It was shipped fast and I have been dipping into it ever since it arrived.  I have given up on sugar and this fit's the bill better then the other substitutes.<br />Seller had item shipped rather quickly.  It was as advertised.
positive,We use a lot of Splenda and this is a great buy.  The product came quickly and in good condition.
positive,Es la segunda vez que compro con este proveedor y el margen de error en las bolsas empacadas es del 2.5% aunque en este &uacute;ltimo pedido lleg&oacute; en un mejor estado.
positive,I USE SPLENDA PACKETS EVERY SINGLE DAY. LOVE THIS PRODUCT AS IT IS CALORIE FREE AND EASY TO USE. ALSO DIABETIC FRIENDLY. I WATCH FOR IT TO GO ON SALE A LOT AS WE USE A LOT
positive,I could not find this product on any store shelf.  Amazon came through.  Makes the best WS's.
negative,The cost of the mix to the number of drinks you get is much to high.
positive,I am happy that i bought the set rather than Individual items. Great deal guys. Cant wait for the great specials!!!
positive,"This is a nice jelly that spreads fairly easily and the bottle makes it easy to apply to your sandwich or whatever else you want jelly for. It has a really nice grape-y flavor, so if you really like grape jelly, give this a try."
negative,"I was disappointed in this product especially considering how exceptional the Salmon Oil they make is.<br /><br />This did not pass the 11 rescue dog test! They just turned up their noses. So did the other dogs here. Very tiny tidbits, as well.Buy an extra bottle of the Grizzly Salmon oil instead."
positive,"We originally tried these treats when we received as a sample. My dog loved them, and i thought the smell was so fishy, no wonder he did!<br />The bag will last a long time. Do not feed too many, as it states on the package. It is a good value. Could even be cut in half or smaller to use as training rewards."
positive,"My dog can't get enough of these things. He gets so excited anytime he even hears the bag crinkle. We were told at obedience class to bring treats our dogs will do anything for and this was my choice. I'm back ordering more. With two labs, I wish I could order in bulk."
negative,"These are excellent treats, my dog really likes them, but from this seller specifically, they arrived almost completely pulverized so it was mostly a bag of salmon dust.  I used them to supplement the dog food, but they were mostly useless as treats."
positive,"I've been giving these to my 2 little dogs for over 5 yrs.  They love them and I love giving them to my girls.<br />They are a nutritious salmon protein treat with essential amino acids and calcium. They're low calorie<br />with no artificial anything.<br />And... they're made from Alaskan Wild Salmon in the Pacific Northwest -- not salmon from the polluted<br />waters of the east coast. We use them for training treats, just because treats and in their puzzle toys.<br />They never lose their interest when rewarded with these treats. I highly recommend."
positive,My dog LOVES these treats! The ingredients are so good for her and they don't cause any allergies or reactions either. Great product!
positive,"It's funny that most of the other reviews talk about using it straight, when I've never used it that way or even thought to try using it as shoyu! I use it as a soup base for zaru soba, somen salad, and udon. We mostly use it for hot udon. You basically put different amounts of water for whatever noodle you're eating and it tastes amazing each time. For instance, udon uses 1 part memmi, 12 parts water. It's extremely simple and tastes soooo good. Me and my daughter always drink the soup after and I make extra now so that we can have a lot of soup to drink with each noodle! This is really an amazingly good sauce! I'm hoping they eventually add subscribe and save for it."
positive,"Although it says ""Soup Base"" on the bottle, my family hardly uses it for that purpose. It works great for everyday cooking and I would describe it as a sweet soy sauce. Try it on any type of meat and cooked vegetables. You can get a 20oz bottle for ~3-4$ at an Asian market."
positive,"This is a wonderful addition to soup stocks or packaged ramen in place of the ""flavor packet"". I use it often and enjoy the unique flavor it adds to chicken stock or water. Well worth experimenting with."
positive,"My lab mix has a very sensitive tummy. He had recurrent bouts of diarrhea, vomiting and constant wretched gas. I had given him pedigree for awhile but realized that was no good for him. Then we tried science diet, but his gas seemed to get worse and his tummy would gurgle all day.<br /><br />I read about this dog food and its natural ingredients. There's no corn meal or other fillers. He's been on this food for about 2 weeks now and his gas has disappeared! He has not had a single bout of diarrhea or vomiting. I'm impressed. Yes it's pricey and I normally wouldn't buy something so expensive, but it is well worth it for the health of my dog.<br /><br />*Updated* to say that he has been on this food for a few months now and has continued to be free of tummy troubles and wretched gas. He hasn't vomited at all or had diarrhea. His coat has gotten so much shinier and he seems to be a much happier dog without all the tummy issues!"
positive,"I love this food. It actually is the only food I have found that my dog is not allergic to. (except for an extremely expensive prescription diet) I have a boxer on this food. He is allergic to almost everything. However, he is not allergic to salmon or sweet potatoes making this food the perfect choice for him. All food related allergies have disappeared and his coat has improved tremendously. He still deals with outdoor allergies, but this food has shown a big improvement in him. The only issue I have had is that he packed on a few extra pounds, which he has now lost. I cut down his dry food amount and mix canned green beans and carrots in with the dry food so he has enough to eat without the extra weight. He loves it and eats every bite!"
positive,The only brand that wont give my doggies the itch and allergies! Been loyal to the brand for 4 years now...
negative,"Be cautious about all store dog foods. My dog had been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish and developed digestive issues and almost died.  I thought it was a number of things. Had lots of tests run and then one of my clients dogs developed the same issues with his dog on the same dog food and has also spent a lot of money trying to correct the gut issue. Can't prove anything as we got rid of the dog food, but since they recalled their Sweet Potato and Chicken this year because of (see below)...Posted: Jun 21, 2010 at 4:00 PM [Jun 21, 2010]<br /><br />In 2007, a pet food recall was issued after the FDA discovered that vegetable proteins imported from China that were used to produce pet foods were contaminated with melamine. Sadly, some animals were sickened, and even died. After this recall, it's fair to say that many of us had become even more aware of how the pet food industry is regulated and how lapses are corrected, which is a great thing. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes.<br /><br />The FDA posted a new announcement for a voluntary pet food recall on June 18 - relating to Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc. More specifically, the company discovered that there was the possibility of salmonella contamination in 5- and 28-pound bags of their Sweet Potato and Chicken Dry Dog Food. Consumers who have purchased that formula need to look for a ""best by"" date of June 17, 2011.<br /><br />Flickr photo courtesy of Denise Chan<br />Salmonella, also referred to as salmonellosis, causes digestive problems, and dogs will typically present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness. Other symptoms can occur.<br />Salmonella is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it can be passed to humans as well, so care needs to be taken. Hand washing is a must - even when handling dry pet food that may be contaminated with the bacteria.<br /><br />To keep up to date with current recalls and information on pet food safety, visit the FDA's website to view the updated list that includes not only dog and cat foods, but also horse feed.<br /><br />[...]"
positive,"I have a Jack Russell Terrier. It has an allergic reaction to chicken and some grains.  This food seems to have solved most if not all of its allergy problems.  The dog had chewed itself raw.  After a couple of weeks of this dog food, hair was growing back with only occasional scratching.  Nothing like it use to be.  I gave it 5 stars because it worked.  Would my dog rather have burger or steak... yes.  But, it does eat this.  I order a bag a week and a half before I run out.  Not as cheap as regular dog food, but saves on the Vet bills.  Fifty dollars a bag for the dog food, versus a minimum, $150 for a visit to the Vet."
negative,My dog has an over abundance of ear wax and the vet suggested I try this food. My dog has been eating this exclusively for 10 days and it has made him sick. He has tons of gas and diarrhea. The only thing positive that I can say is that he liked the taste.
negative,"I was very happy with this product at first, as it solved my little dog's skin problems. Now, almost 2 years later, my dog has developed really bad cough allergy. I have solidly confirmed the food is the root cause by stopping & trying it again. I just want to mention that this is a 2nd time we have to discontinue dog food after years of use, due to newly developed allergies."
negative,"I have been a faithful buyer of Natural Balance for years for my large dog with allergies.  Thinking I was getting the best.<br /><br />My dog developed a yeast infection that my vet told me was allergies.  He has constant ear infections, itching and he started to lose weight. His skin was like an elephant and it started to flake off.  Turns out the potatoes and sweet potatoes in the Potato and Venison dog foods was feeding the yeast infection and it was killing him.  He was losing weight and went from 75 pounds to 57 pounds before we found out the cause. I contacted the food company who were no help at all.  They didn't even respond to my reply.  I wasn't asking for any miracles, I just wanted some answers and I got a big fat NOTHING.<br /><br />After switching vets my new vet discovered the yeast infection and we switched the dog food.  He started to gain weight but we have a long road ahead of us to keep the yeast at bay.<br /><br />I am just disappointed in the company's customer service. I spent about $50 on a bag of food every two weeks plus treats.  My money will be better spent elsewhere."
positive,"My ten month old doxie/mix started having horrible stomach problems.  She would regurgitate her food within minutes after eating it.  After spending $1000 at the vet and having no reason for why she was getting sick, I decided to look into a different kind of food.  She was on Wellness before and the vet switched her to a special canned food.  Then he had me switch her to Science Diet Sensitive Stomach.  She did fine on the canned food, but got sick with the Science Diet.  Once I started this food, she stopped getting sick.  It was a miracle!  Her gas has gone away and she has kept the food down for over two months.  I'm so happy with this food!  I switched her brother onto the food too, and they both love it."
negative,"Natural Balance dog food is great, but the dog food I purchased from Amazon was not completely satisfactory.  There was about a 4 pound clump of dog food that was so hard and compressed, it would have been unreasonable to break apart or use.  a 5 pound bag of this dog food goes for $13, so  I feel like I lost money on this purchase for the convenience of having it delivered instead of an in-store pickup.  I won't be purchasing dog food from Amazon again.  I don't feel as if they rotate the food out as well as it would if one were to purchase it from Petco or PetSmart."
negative,"I ordered the natural balance salmon dry dog food because I had good luck with the natural balance salmon dry cat food.  Further, I am a pescatarian and was disappointed to see how almost every dry dog and cat food brand at the grocery stores and on the market contain chicken, lamb, or beef bi -products.  I love my dogs, but I cannot see feeding baby lamb to my dog! Even the ""only fish"" labelled dog and cat foods on the market often contain chicken, etc when you look on the ingredients list.  So I was very pleased to find a cost effective solution to this in natural balance.  The only issue is that my dogs will not touch this food! They would rather starve than eat it it seems, perhaps because it is the diet formula?  I'm not sure.  However, I will say that they all (including the cat) flock to the Natural Balance salmon dry cat food lol so I will continue ordering that for the cat."
positive,"I bought this food having bought several of their other flavors previously. However, this particular flavor does not agree with my dog's system. That being said I can't say enough good things about the Natural Balance company."
positive,"My pure bread yellow lab is surprisingly a very picky eater and after going through several other brands this is the only food he will eat.  He doesn't have allergies that we're aware of and hasn't had any bad reactions to other foods, he just won't eat them.  Now I've moved to an area where I can't get this food at a nearby store, so I've come to Amazon.com to start ordering it regularly for delivery."
negative,"This product made my dog very sick. He is an older 11 year old pug with allergies and this particular mix is supposed to be good with allergies. I decided to try it because my vet had run out of Science Diet Salmon and Sweet Potato and I found this very reputable looking dog food with free shipping on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Within 3 days off feeding it to my dog he seemed to loose all energy and my wife was concerned we wouldn't have him very much longer. I then Googled the brand and found a recall due to salmonella contamination! Granted, the recall wasn't on this specific mix, but when I tried to contact the company they haven't even bothered to respond within four days! I ran out and found another vet who carries science diet and within a day or two my dogs is energetic and back to his old self.  This dog food is supposed to be 100% guaranteed, just return the unused portion back to the retailer - yeah, shipping 28 lbs of dog food back to Amazon and finding the box it will fit in  is real convenient..."
positive,"I have a 7 year old female Newfoundland who has had allergy problems for years.  I have tried all sorts of things except buying hypoallergenic dog food.  After reading review about this food, I thought I would give it a try.  She is getting around much better, has more energy, quit licking hair off feet, ears getting better, and her coat is getting more beautiful color back(bronze).  Financially it is not easy to buy this food! I have 6 dogs total, a few I found and took in, not that we can afford to.  In this difficult economy people are just dropping their dogs off and the shelters are full.  I would love to have all my dogs on a good food like Natural Balance but can not afford it.  So, my Newfoundland will be the only one on it because of her problems."
negative,"My dog was eating this food and has had bad gas, bloody and loose stools.  We have stopped giving this to him but we are still trying to get his tummy troubles under control.  All blood tests, stool tests, and urine tests have come back OK."
negative,"I don't know what happened to my favorite coffee, santa white christmas coffee, but barnies really turned this coffee into tasteless coffee I will never buy again... what a shame"
positive,"this is a lightweight gaiter that is easy-on and easy off.the only improvement that i can imagine would be the zipper,which is a little hard to engage."
negative,I have bough Larry's coffee in the past and it was ok. This last batch was awful! The beans were not fresh and it taste only slightly better than Maxwell house! do yourself a favor and get coffee from coffee bean direct on amazon. WAY better coffee at a way better price
positive,"The SHU strength of this cayenne is listed as being about one-third less than  the capsules I was using (90,000)but it tastes just as HOT! You can tell it is also very fresh.<br /><br />Some advice: Try to use whatever amount you take either sprinkled on food or, like I do, about an eight to one-quarter teaspoon mixed with about 8 oz of liquid. If you take the capsule form straight (which you can open up), it will shock your system when it explodes in your stomach, possibly doing harm."
positive,"The seller is really nice.<br />The paste teases good.<br />I am a Chinese and I love Korean food.<br />It's nice to make pibim pap(dont know how to type it in English) ''' 'noodles.<br />I also used it in kimchi.<br />It's not very hot, also has a little bit sweet flavor.<br />Worth it to have a try!"
positive,"I use rice bran in place of flour--has the texture of flour, very high in fiber, no gluten, and great taste--"
positive,This product adds nice flavor and fiber to home baked breads.  Just substitute 1/4 cup Rice Bran for up to 1/4 cup of the total Gluten Free blend of choice in your recipe.
positive,"Anyways, I use this in raw porridge recipe, it is very nutritious and moves your bowels too (excuse me). It has vitamins, and lots of fiber to control the blood sugar concurring with the other reviews.<br /><br />It best eaten raw, so all the nutrients are intact. I recommended with other raw seeds, and wheat bran, raisins, and milk."
positive,It is delicious even raw! I love this stuff. I like quite a few of Bob's Red Mill products.
positive,"This rice bran is the absolute best tasting of all the brands that I have tried.  Some of the others have a bitter taste. This has a sweet taste which results in me being able to reduce the sugar in the recipes. I use it to add fiber to cake recipes with brown rice flour, as I am allergic to wheat.  I recommend this product over all other brands & give it the maximum number of stars.  It can also be ordered directly from the manufacturer.  For the best price, be sure to compare shipping rates."
positive,I am enjoying many benefits from this grain. The fact that it's a stabilized bran results in more nutrients being available after the processing and presumably a longer shelf life as well. I am using it daily as a supplement to treat a chronic condition with success to date. The antioxidents in rice bran can only help immunity and general health. I recommend adding it to your diet.
positive,I make quite a bit of bread in my bread machine.  Several of my recipes call for rice bran but I was unable to find it in my local grocery stores.  I was pleased to find it on Amazon at such a great price!  I froze the other 3 bags and have good luck in the past freezing flours.  The bread I made with this bran was fabulous!!
negative,"You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals, B vitamins and a lower glycemic index?<br /><br />Well, maybe that's a pile of noise.<br /><br />Maybe the people in Japan and China actually know what they're doing this time (just like pretty much every other time). Maybe the miniscule quantities of vitamins and minerals in brown rice are more than outweighed by allergens and other noxious things (like cyanide) in the bran, which help prevent baby rice grains in the wild from being devoured in the first place.<br /><br />On the other hand, I gotta say, it *does* taste good."
positive,"It's gum, it's green.  That about sums it up.  It tastes like green mint, too."
negative,"I'm so sorry I bought this.  I've purchased this product in stores and it has been great; but what I purchased on line was old and rancid...I had to throw out $90 worth of junk.  I'm beyond disappointed, it smelled, and my dog wouldn't even eat it.  LLM"
negative,I had bought similar treats for my dogs in the past and they loved them.  But these came individually wrapped in plastic which permeated the chew with a plastic smell (and I assume flavor).  My dogs won't touch them.  Don't waste your money.
positive,"They definitely came through on their promise to not have a single duplicate! It is pretty awesome if you are a coffee snob and want to taste a veriety of different flavors. I surely found what I did NOT like, but my pallet is not refined enough to sort through so much variety.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a smaller variety pack, unless you just want to spend a lot!"
negative,"My brewer lasted for three uses. After three uses it no longer pumps any water. I called customer service, because I spent extra money on a commercial brewer, I can only get it fixed through a technician who has a prohibitive call queue.  I have called back a total a five times, and each time I am told that a technician will call me back. This has yet to happen over the last month that I have been trying to fix this. Had I bought a cheaper one from Walmart, this issue would have been resolved already. Do not buy this brewer. If it breaks, expect zero customer service from Keurig and to be out whatever money you have paid for it."
positive,"When I first tried Keurig it was a B150 at my new office and the B130 in our affiliates office. Both has a quick and easy way of making coffee while maintaining temperature with each cup. I had used these items for a few months, only to find myself wanting one. While I find the standard models repulsive, The B150 & B155 is a elegant machine that looks modern and has a touch screen to make a dull counter top exciting.<br /><br />You get a fresh tasty cup of coffee within 20 seconds and it is fast and easy to use. I use mine 3 times a day for coffee, hot apple cider (yum) and cocoa which all taste stellar.<br /><br />I do have to say you MUST order your K cups online to get the best deal, but Dunkin Donuts is probably the best coffee that tastes like it came from the store.<br /><br />A great investment and great coffee, you can't beat it!"
negative,"We bought two of these machines. The first one was put into action without running the flushing cycle, so understandably it gave off the plastic taste. But you would think that after a few months, the taste would go away.<br /><br />A few months later, the second unit was bought. This time we meticulously ran it through the flushing cycle. The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star."
positive,"my yorkiepoo ate it like a treat... we mixed it with his pedigree to transition him on the new food. Haven't seen any changes in his bowels as of yet. I was initially worried about his kidney, based on another review since he's a small dog.  If anything changes I will update it here."
positive,"Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get ""tummy trouble"" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of ""juice,"" so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more ""food,"" and are a much better value."
positive,"This is the only wet food that my kitties like (and boy do they like it!). Wellness is expensive in comparison to grocery store brands, but the quality is superior and I believe the price is worth it. Amazon has the best prices I've found."
positive,My 2 cats eat Wellness grain free in cans in the turkey and chicken flavors.  I thought I would try the  pouches in this turkey & chicken grain free  recipe to see if they would eat chunky food. They loved it from the first taste. They eat the chunks first and then lick the gravy.  80 calories a pouch. So now they eat both Wellness canned and pouches. I feel like they are eating very healthy and getting the needed water in their food. Amazon always has it packaged well and I get it fast.
positive,"My cat loves these. We call them packets and she perks up and gets excited if we say packet. we call her packet cat. haha. anyway. This is way over priced on here though.. I get them for .95 cents each.. that adds up to $22 for 24, not $30 for 24 like they are on sale for here. I get mine at stateline pet supply in plaistow nh. I would look around before purchasing them for thebest price if i were you."
positive,"Even with shipping charges this is still cheaper than purchasing from a pet store, plus it arrived quickly. My cat is 15 and was developing health issues, the vet said he needed more water content and this brand has the best gravy ever. I switched him from an all dry diet to two pouches a day of Wellness, with a bit of dry sprinkled on top and he loves it. Cleans the bowl!"
positive,Most of my cats really like this Wellness Turkey and Duck flavor food. I wish the sauce was a little thicker like the other varieties. Wellness makes high quality pet foods with great ingredients that are good for our pets.
positive,"My cas love this high quality, healthy food. Wellness pouches are a great food for all cats of all ages."
positive,"Excellent, high quality product. In particular a great way to get your finicky kitty to consume more liquids, as the gravy seems irresistible even for the most picky of eaters."
positive,"My cats love this food and one of them doesn't usually touch canned food.  I know that canned food is much better for them and I feel better that this product does not include unhealthy grains.  There is a lot of juice in this, but the picky cat really likes to lick up the juice. I haven't seen any problems with vomiting since I switched them to this."
positive,"My picky cat loves Wellness cat food. He will eat the pouches but he prefers the can style cat food. However, either one will work...my cat digs Wellness cat food."
positive,"Princess gets a pouch of food every morning. I rotate so she doesn't have to get the same every day. She usually have three different at any given time. This was the first time I purchased Turkey and Duck. These seem to be harder to get out of the pouch than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I first shake the pouch to get everything to settle in the bottom, then I pull it open. So far, so good. But when I then turn it over, the food gets ""stuck"" in the pouch a bit. So I usually make sure I open the opening first and shake it a little bit around, turn it on its head, and start milking it out. That seems to work.<br /><br />The Princess seems to like it, so I will continue buying."
positive,"When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the ""nuggets in gravy"" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being."
positive,"My boyfriend bought a pack as a one-off to tempt his aged kitty- who can be finicky- into eating. His Kitty was uninterested at the time, so I took it home to my little eating machine, who wolfed it down. She's been eating Wellness products almost exclusively for the past two years, and I was interested in finding a gravy-rich wet food in this line. The tuna chunks are substantial - but not too big - and are in a thick, rich gravy. I feed her a mix of 1 pouch of wet food and 1/2 cup of dry daily, and she is both happy and of normal weight. I highly recommend this food for being grain-free, as my cat has had issues with extra fiber clogging her digestive tract in the past, and free of odd, unrecognizable (and unpronounceable) ingredients."
positive,"Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get ""tummy trouble"" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of ""juice,"" so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more ""food,"" and are a much better value."
negative,"The ""Healthy Indulgence"" pouches of cat food are prepared with FLUORIDATED water! A number of studies have now shown that fluoridated water increases the risk of osteosarcoma or bone cancer in humans and animals. Alone from my own circle of friends, two have lost their pets to bone cancer, most likely as a result of the animals' having consumed fluoridated water! BUYER BEWARE!"
negative,"A real waste of $$$ - Don't know what I was expecting...the product's own PR only makes vague claims for renewed health after drinking this over 2 days.<br />Didn't bring about any sort of ""cleanse"" (as in colonic) for me; don't feel any better (or worse); bloating not reduced; energy level still low.<br />Does, indeed, taste horrible but I actually got used to it - it was only for 2 days! Very bitter with a sort of stale oil smell/taste, which might be from the acai since the fluid contains no oil products.<br />The only Maybe Possible good thing is that it keeps you on a schedule, making you very aware of when you're supposed to drink your ""cocktail"" and what you may have eaten since the last drink...subconciously keeps you a bit more honest on your diet??<br />It didn't harm me, didn't give me gas or headaches, didn't interrupt my sleep or make me jittery - but the same could be said for a lot of low-cal food items (H2O, anyone?).<br />Stick to Vitaminwaters, Lean Cuisines and more exercise!"
positive,"Who knows if it actually detoxed me, but it tasted HORRIBLE! No matter what you mix it with."
negative,the little wax bottles had melted together in a big messy blob of wax with the liquid leaking out in all directions.
positive,"These are great treats that I wish Amazon.com carried as part of its regular stock. These are essentially wax bottles of flavored sweets in them that vanish quickly when you're doing mindless work. Just bite off bits and chew them until the liquid is gone, then spit out the wax. They taste great and nice treats for kids as well. Summer candy they ain't, and the wax can melt unless shipped with an ice pack. The downside is the shipping price."
positive,"I love these thing, I love chewing and drinking the juice. nostalgia! Who doesn't love these things? Just know I like em."
positive,I don't know why but my kids love these. I must admit that they actually do taste good and I remember as a kid I loved them. Big hit with the kids!
positive,"My boyfriend was telling me one night that he uses to love these but couldn't find them anymore, well i found this one pound bag for him and sent it to him directly and make him very happy for a few hours"
positive,I remember these from when I was a kid...they haven't changed a bit.  Yummy drink inside the wax bottle.  My 8 year old son and his friends love them
negative,"The wax candy arrived in one big wax blob.IT was too much of a pain in the butt to send back,so I threw it away.TOtal waste of my hard earned money! It says returns are easy...NOT TRUE!!!"
negative,"They were indeed tasty, but I guess I just don't understand the appeal. A small amount of liquid encased in wax. It has a certain novelty to it, but mostly it's just odd. I am sorry if my rating seems undeserved by people who like this candy. It's not that I don't appreciate old-fashioned candy. Some of it is great. But some of it went out of style for a reason."
positive,"This was bought as a Christmas gift.  It arrived well packaged and the gift was well received.  Hershey Chocolate Kisses are just that, the wrapping was Christmas like."
positive,"Dogs love them and they are made the best way, They are about $4.00 cheaper that the pet stores and no tax"
positive,"Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but ""small"", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient."
positive,"OK I have to admit that the first time I tried to buy this tower of treats was on Valentine's Day.  I accidentally ordered the non-vegan version so my sons and nephew ate half of it, then when we weren't looking the dog ate all the rest.  I ordered the vegan tower of treats (same items as the regular one, but without animal-based ingredients).  All of the treats were delicious!  I must say that if I could get a tower of just their vegan carrot cakes I'd buy that too!  That carrot cake was simply incredible!  The dog did not get a chance at these treats this time!  I will buy this vegan tower of treats for every special occasion."
positive,"I had a sample at the Albanese factory in Indiana, and this is the best gummy candy they had. Don't get me wrong, I liked the other candy like the gummy bears and stuff but this was the tastiest one ever!!! I recommend this candy to anyone that likes sweet stuff."
positive,Not the best gummy rings out there. They are very good though. If you are a hater of sweet don't get them ;). I myself have little to complain about. Huge gummy ring fan. Buy them and enjoy!
negative,"I ordered these along with some of the sour bears to try from this Albanese brand.  I received a box of melted candy that was unrecognizable. It was warm still in Arizona in September, but this was something you would expect to happen to chocolate candy but not to gummi rings or bears.  Be warned if you order this brand in warm months you may open the box to find a scary looking surprise. This has never happened to me with the Haribo brand so I will stick to those from now on.  Amazon did refund the price, they are great about that if you call them up and whine a little."
positive,"Best cornbread in the world if you're looking for TRUE cornbread from the South !!  NOT SWEET, YAY !!  You can't go wrong ! Great with just about everything !"
negative,"The actual Chestnut Cream itself was wonderful. It is a favorite of my mother's from her home country of France. The problem is not with the product, but with the shipping. The first time I ordered it for her, all six cans were so dented in the box that we were scared to open them. The one piece of packing material,a completely deflated ballon, did not keep the cans from rolling around in a box way to large for them. Amazon did resend us the product at Amazon's expense (best customer service ever!), but once again the bag was nearly flat and the can were very damaged...except one and that one was very tasty though it cost $26. My advice don't buy can goods through the mail."
positive,This reminds me of summer. Just picked berries on the vine paired with a sweet matcha and chocolate. Did I mention the chocolate?  Yum!
positive,"My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!"
negative,"I picked this up at my local Rite Aid. It was only a dollar for an 8pk, so I decided to try them. The fact that I could not find an exp. date should have been a warning. These are horrible, hard and firm like jujube, and leaves a nasty too-sweet-almost-bitter aftertaste. Global Brands is batting 0 for 2 so far. Their Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate is also far off the mark."
negative,"Perhaps these snacks are ten years old;  I tried, but failed, to find an expiration date.  These Fruit Snacks are firm with an almost crispy outer surface -and not much flavor to boot.  I bought these because Global Brand's Strawberry Fruit Snacks are pretty good (if not stellar);  I would steer shoppers toward that flavor or another product entirely."
positive,Good price for the Chex Snacks.<br />Quick delivery and arrived in good condition.<br />Will order again...I have been quite pleased with the Amazon Grocery purchases I've made over the last few months.
positive,"I recently ordered several varieties of flavored stevia, and liked them for the most part.  The orange is a little bitter when used in drinks.<br /><br />It works to sweeten, but thn you don't taste much orange.  If you use enough to taste the orange, your drink is very bitter from too much sweetening.  It's a great concept though!"
positive,"I have been very happy with this product!  I have tried almost all the  flavors, but the Valencia Orange is my favorite.  I feel it is the most versatile of the flavors available.  I have been using this for over a year now and enjoy it on a daily basis in my water bottle and also add it to my tea, iced or hot.  A little goes a long way.  It is not too sweet but very light and refreshing.  Highly recommended!"
positive,"Great product! Lasts for a very long time and is ideal for the HCG diet! Tastes wonderful, really good with sliced lemons!"
positive,"Plain water is just so ""Bla"". Now it has a great orange taste, and I'm drinking more of it. Just add a few drops and enjoy!!!  This has taken the place of drinking soda, now that's a ""good thing""."
negative,"I have tried several flavors of Sweetleaf products, and have had no problems. The ones I recently received seem to be watered down. I used to be able to sweeten a one liter bottle of seltzer with two full squirts of the stuff. Now with two squirts, i barely taste it. My friend noticed the same issue with the Berry flavor i purchased for her!"
positive,"I occasionally like to add a little flavor to my club soda or mineral water & this gives me a healthy choice. For me it's very sweet, because I really restrict my carb intake. It only takes a couple of drops in a 16 oz. bottle of water, to satisfy me."
negative,"I got this to add to water, to help my son drink more. he hates it...and I dont like it either leaves a funny after taste"
positive,This stevia valencia orange is great.  I put a few drops in my water bottle as I hate to drink water and it really lightens up the taste and therefore I drink more water.  Like the lemon stevia drops also.
positive,"SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia Valencia Orange works fine as a sweetener.  In fact, it's very sweet, almost cloying.  But it doesn't do much to provide orange flavor.  I would put it in the category of a sweetener, not a flavor enhancer.  I thought I could add a few drops of this to a glass of water and have a refreshing orangey beverage, but what I get is a super-sweet glass of water with a barely detectable hint of orange.  I may use this in hot or iced tea on occasion but doubt I will use it as a stand-alone flavor enhancer.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweetener and are familiar with the super sweetness of Stevia, this is worth trying.  But if you're looking for something with a strong orange flavor, you won't find it here."
positive,"I've been using Stevia as my sweetener for over 10 years. I've always used the KAL white powder Stevia, as I like the taste best of all. Now I found the SweetLeaf Luquid stevia, and at first I tried the Hazelnut flavor (yummy), and then I gave a try to Chocolate-Raspberry and Orange flavor. I love love the orange flavor in my coffee, oatmeal or Greek yogurt. It gives just gentle touch of orange, but you can definitely taste it."
positive,"It's okay, but the citrus flavor is not as pervasive as I expected. Tastes fake. Some of the Sweet Leaf flavors are excellent, this one is merely average."
negative,"These Sweetleaf ""flavored"" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution."
positive,"The best macaroni and cheese ever. Thank goodness for Amazon,can't find this in the grocery stores where I live. The bacon just adds a little something extra to set it aside from regular macaroni and cheese."
positive,"It's got the creamy, cheesy flavor of the original with the added smokiness of bacon!  Quick, easy, delicious!"
negative,"There is something just completely wrong with the way the bacon bits that are packaged with the Velveeta Shells and Cheese taste.  Additionally the cheese sauce does not taste the same as the regular Shells and Cheese sauce, and not in a good way.  Stick with the original."
positive,This salt is a salt lovers dream come true. It is amazing on everything I've tried. I reccommend this salt for every home that has taste buds.
positive,"These mints repulsed me after a whiff at a local candy, but I decided to get them anyway since they didn't have any latte mints. Once I tried them it was like:<br /><br />A unicorn<br />pooping glitter<br />whilst dancing on a rainbow<br />at a One Direction concert."
positive,"I love this tea.  Ahmad tea is just a perfect cup of tea.  English Tea No. 1 is my tea of choice.  It's perfectly balanced and never bitter, no matter how long it's brewed.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you want to purchase English Tea No. 1 in it's loose form, you have to buy ""English Afternoon Tea"" loose.  Please note, however, that in teabag form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are two distinct blends.  But in loose form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are on in the same. I don't know why that's the case, but that's what a representative from Ahmad Tea told me when I emailed them to ask where I can buy English Tea No. 1 in loose form.<br /><br />I purchased loose English Afteroon Tea (aka Eng. Tea No. 1) from another online purveyor, and the loose version of the tea is just as delicious (maybe even more so) than the bagged version.  the loose tea is whole leaf tea, which is hard to find in a black tea.  usually, loose black tea is very finely shredded, not altogether different from its bagged form.  but the loose Ahmad black tea is whole leaf, which just goes to show how high the quality is at Ahmad tea.<br /><br />all in all, a terrific tea, and highly recommended."
positive,"My family is from England and we love tea. We were given this tea as a gift. We were skeptical at first, but fell in love with it as soon as we tasted it. Truly a perfect tea! We love it as both hot tea or Sun tea!"
positive,"I originally received this tea in a holiday gift basket.  I've been a tea drinker all my life, so I'm rather opinionated as to what I like and what I don't.  This is by far the best tea I've ever had!!  I can't find it locally, but have been lucky enough to find it on-line.  It has a very unique flavor that you just can't find in your typical Lipton or Red Rose tea."
positive,"We received a gift basket with this tea in it for Christmas. When my wife tried it she couldn't get over how great it tasted. Being a tea drinker all of her adult life and fancying herself as knowing a good tea from a bad she just had to have a supply of this tea. We couldn't find a local store that carried it so we went to Amazon to order some. The company that we ended up with wasted no time in getting the tea to us without difficulty. Of course once you add in the shipping the price of the tea goes up, but that's a small price to pay in order to make my wife a happy woman."
positive,"Makes the best tasting Iced tea, one of the best iced teas I've had. It also is a good hot tea. Great company"
positive,The only problem with this tea is that you going through it too FAST:)Great flavor!Love it!!!
positive,"Since I was diagnosed with type II diabetes, This is the only drink I drink. It taste great and has enough sweetness to it to be very satisfying."
positive,"I don't personally eat this product so I can't vouch for the flavor and texture. I do, however, buy it here and buy it often as I donate it regularly to my church for their special dinners for the homeless, those in need, and fundraiser suppers.<br /><br />The pastor tells me that those who do the cooking for the church, as well as those being served enjoy it a lot and many ask for 'seconds'. The pastor advises me it makes a great side dish and helps to fill up hungry tummies  while being so easy to make. On occasion, the church cooks will add their own additional onions and celery, but it isn't necessary as this stuffing includes all that and more. And,because this is a 'herb' flavor, adding chicken stock or turkey stock vs. water makes it even more complimentary to a chicken/turkey meal.<br /><br />The price here at Amazon is better than that at the local grocery stores, esp. with my Prime for free shipping. I can also get it in 1-2 days if the church needs extra with short notice. Good deal, good product, prompt service.<br /><br />Edit: 2-25-10 (after-thought). All one needs to add to this product is butter and water. Depending on how moist/dry one prefers stuffing, simply add more/less water. Our church roasts turkeys and hen turkeys in large quantities very often and we strain and freeze the 'au jus' from them in 12 oz plastic containers. Occasionally, rather than using up our butter supply for stuffing, we substitute the defrosted au jus from the turkey. This seems to be the preferred 'flavor' by those enjoying the meals."
negative,"Very disappointed in this stuffing mix. There was hardly any flavor. To get the ""Savory Herb"" taste, I had to add herbs and spices of my own and even then, it was still kind of tasteless. Canceled my ""Subscribe and Save"" on this one. Nothing like the ""Chicken Everyday"". Now THERE is the perfect seasoning!"
positive,My Bichons like this and I like the ingredients.  Good for the price.  Wish it were on subscribe and save.
positive,Both my chihuahua's love this moist healthy dog food. Nice that I can buy it locally but the price through amazon was much cheaper.
positive,"I still remember when mom or one of my brothers prepared this dessert, it took longer to cook than the time we took to finish it. And is just great that I can make it now that I'm married and my loved ones can taste the same lemon pie like in the old days.<br />Easy to make easier to enjoy."
positive,"The grocery chains don't seem to carry the cook and serve in lemon flavor, had to buy a case,ended up sharing with friends. Makes GREAT pie!"
positive,"Have been using this product for years. It mixes up fast and consistant every time, makes a great pie. I have had difficulty finding this item @ my local grocery store. Was thilled to be able to order it from Amazon."
positive,"This product is ideal - I use it all the time.  It's just perfect for an afternoon or evening coffee break for 1 or 2 people, especially those who might be sensitive to caffeine later in the day.  I always keep this on hand.  The taste is rich, but not bitter like some of the newer coffee blends on the market."
positive,"My Mom & Dad are at the age where they need things to be easy and this fits the bill.  My Mom loves this no mess way to make coffee and my Dad loves that there are in no grounds in his coffee, which is a problem with the small coffee makers. The best thing is that it is every bit as good if not better than the loose coffee.<br /><br />Our local supermarkets dropped the decaf version, so happy I found it here and love that it is shipped right to their door."
positive,great service wish there were more then 4 to a order would perfer 6 at a time
positive,"I have diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture."
negative,"I purchased this food because I am trying to feed my cats a near grain free diet and this is one of the few I could find.  That's the good part, well that and this is the only one of the purina fancy feast classics that didn't contain fish either!  Now, the bad part is that my cat would eat this about one can in twenty meaning there is a quality control issue.  After the some research on this matter, I came across the ugly....check out the reviews at consumeraffairs.com (just google consumeraffairs purina -- sorry but amazon site stripped the link when I inserted into the review).  So, be careful as Purina is the major supplier of most pet foods and after reading those HUNDREDS of complaints....they will never again get my business."
positive,"I wish Amazon would get more of the ""classic"" pate varieties of Fancy Feast.  My cats won't eat the other types (shreds, lumps, pieces).  But they love the pate ""classic"" varieties.  Please get more flavors, Amazon!  I will buy them all!"
negative,"This one was the reject surprise of the day.  Both cats wouldn't touch it at all - surprised me because one in particular is a turkey junky.  Can't figure this one out - it smells nice in the can, not strange odors that I can detect anyway.  It's pretty expensive to just toss but well, that's what I had to do.  It is healthy for your cat and it is a pate, not chunks.  However, that said, they don't care for the chunky Fancy Feast turkey variety either.  Not sure why - they gobble up the Friskies turkey and cheese like there's no tomorrow.  Not sure what to recommend here but to try it and see if your cat likes it.  Maybe it's just too boring! :)"
positive,My cats really love this.  I have 4 cats and they all munch down. I have been buying it at Walmart but they seem to be changing their product line and sometimes I can't get it.
positive,"This is a good value, we save even more with scheduled monthly delivery. Really helps with a 4 cat family! Saves us about $2.00 over chain stores."
positive,"My Cats love it, I will order again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKHN8"">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Senior Cat, Chicken Flavor, 18 Pound Bag</a>"
negative,"package received was involved in the Diamond foods voluntary recall of Spring 2012.<br />I returned to a local store for replacement.  So much for SAFE, EASY online orders."
positive,"We have tried several brands (Iams, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Wellness Core, etc) and formulas (Digestive Health, Sensitive Stomach, etc.) over the past six years and nothing helped Mollie's daily vomiting. For months on end, we would scrub mounds of throw up. Finally, after doing some research, I decided to give Chicken Soup a try. She loves it, and the mounds are almost non-existent! We feel relieved to have finally found something that works with and for Mollie."
negative,"For the health-conscious - read the ingredients.<br /><br />Aspartame:<br /><br />Aspartame accounts for over 75 percent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA.

positive,"My dentist actually recommended this gum, but I was already chewing it. It has great texture and doesn't get tough in my mouth. I have pretty thin enamel so I'll take any help I can get to avoid more fillings!"
positive,"I loooooooooove this tea! It is simply delicious; I have shared it with many friends, and it's always a hit. Anyone who loves ginger will love it. The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste."
positive,"Hi again,<br /><br />I will just say, you will love these sour belts.<br /><br />Take care"
positive,Very fresh you can not find the watermelon very often in the store.If you do they cost per pc 10 to 20 cents each. Love them &lt;3
negative,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Sour Power fan...<br /><br />Peach, Strawberry, Strawberry Bananna, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, I love them all.<br /><br />But this is my first time trying the watermelon flavor...and it just has some major problems.<br /><br />Or really, just one big problem.<br /><br />The sour coating on the outside is classic Sour Power, which is great...but the belts themselves have a REALLY off putting plastic flavor that comes as a part of the watermelon flavoring. If you get it you'll know what I mean. None of the other Sour Power belts have this taste, it literally tastes like plastic and watermelon perfume compressed themselves into a belt and rolled in Sour Power powder.<br /><br />I love Sour Power as much as everyone, but next time I buy a HUGE tub (probably quite soon), it'll be of any other flavor."
positive,"Let me preface this by saying that this is NOT peppermint oil even though it comes up if you search on the phrase ""peppermint oil"".<br /><br />I make peppermint bark every year for Xmas and I usually get peppermint oil for it because some non-oil based extracts can cause the melted chocolate to seize up. However, I had decided to make peppermint bark fudge this year so the fact that it's not oil isn't a big factor.<br /><br />The flavour is quite strong and you won't have to use much to get a good peppermint flavour.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a flavouring, but if you're making chocolate candy and don't have much experience, I would suggest you find actual peppermint oil if you don't want to risk seizing."
positive,"I have had a hard time finding really good decaf.  (Or good at all for that matter, especially flavored.) I stumbled across this company while searching and tried them out a while ago and fell in love.  I cannot say enough about this company and the coffee.  Excellent customer service and the coffee is great.  I just keep coming back.  I highly recommend this company and their coffee.  The maple coffee is great.  I would recommend trying many flavors as I have found them to be excellent!!"
positive,"This small delicious mouthwatering box of chocolate made a strong impression on its recipient, whom i sent it as a gift. The superb taste and beautiful packaging makes it a well rounded affordable item which i would highly recommend to all. Its freshness and soft scrumptious cream makes its taste a special chocolate creamy combo for all chocoholics."
negative,"Really need to know how many cans also, as the other reviewer<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QSN1ZW"">Friskies Whitefish and Tuna Buffet Canned Cat Food</a>  Thanks"
positive,"I thought it would taste similar to 7-UP, but it's really better or at least different enough so that it has its own flavor. I like the Key Lime  better then lime, or at least it's a new flavor to me in a soda.<br />All in all; a top of the line Key Lime soda."
positive,"This is a very tasty product. I love the idea of all natural, and the flavor is outstanding.  I had a little trouble with the texture, but it certainly is leathery!  My little neice loved them, and healthy to. Very good."
negative,"Forgive the Scripture reference, but I am a professor of New Testament and Early Christian Origins. :) John's experience of eating the scroll was mine drinking this coffee: in my mouth it was sweet as honey, but my stomach became embittered. And I have a very strong stomach. It's a fine tasting drink, but I have tried it on several occasions over the course of two months to be sure and every time I end up feeling sick. Obviously this is not the effect for the majority of drinkers, but I would have wanted to have been warned myself before buying it."
positive,"Tried this  coffee for the first time & found it has surprised me.  Brewed it with my drip coffee maker and it makes a bold, smooth cup of coffee.  Definitely would recommend it!"
positive,Great gift. Fast delivery. Quality product.
negative,"I ordered this for a custodian at the high school I teach at, she was still working while on the wait-list for a liver transplant.  It was so cute, and I knew it would really be a pick-me-up for her.  It was supposed to arrive in ten business days, but never came at all, not while she was still working, or even after she got worse and was home bound waiting.  I know this is true, because I didn't know her home address, so I told them to deliver it to the school....so I know it never came.  I have e-mailed the company several times, and they have never replied, although they still spam me with info on new items...as if I would ever order from them again.  Buyer beware - the company I bought mine from was a total rip-off!"
positive,"I sent this to a sick friend and she really appreciated it(not that she would've told me if she hated it).  It's thoughtful, as any gift basket is, but also cute, and perfect for the get-well scenario.  Hey, if you're going to be sick, you might as well get presents, right?"
negative,"For $40.00 - $50.00 save your $$$<br /><br />it's okay, but really take 5 minutes and go to your local CVS, Rite Aide, etc - and put something together.<br /><br />It's just my opinion -"
positive,Very pleased with my Jif Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter.  This is great for baking Peanut Butter Cookies.  There are so many crisp and fresh peanuts in every cookie.  My family just loves baking day.
positive,Jif Extra Crunchy Peanut butter is the best tasting buy far. We have tried many brands and have settled on this one as our favorite. We like the big chuncks of peanuts and just like to just eat it by the spoonfull as a snack. Yum!
positive,"This is my new favorite salad dressing. I went to an upscale Italian restaurant and fell in love with their homemade house dressing. In fact, I had to go there twice in a two day period just because I found myself craving the dressing.<br /><br />I went to the grocery store in search of a a similar dressing and scored a home run with this one. I'm not sure if the restaurants house dressing was better, or this one, but this one is really good.<br /><br />I like to marinate chicken in it, top a green salad with olives, tomato, and cucumbers, or even just drizzle it over a stuffed pita sandwich. I also like to finely dice carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, and tomatoes and top it with this dressing for a quick salad or healthy topping after marinating in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. It's also good for dipping grilled chicken breast strips.<br /><br />The calories are low on this dressing at only 60 calories per serving. Unlike thick dressings like ranch or honey mustard, this one really does only require the suggested serving of two tablespoons since it's thinner and coats everything very well.<br /><br />Diabetics will be glad to know there is only one gram of sugar per serving, and it also has no trans fats.<br /><br />For an Italian salad dressing, this is my top pick."
positive,"So many soup and stew recipes I use call for bay leaves--they add such a subtle taste nuance. But I'm overwhelmed by the price for a small jar at the grocery store. I bought this .62 oz bottle online and saved a bundle without sacrificing quality. Thanx, Amazon and McCormick's!"
positive,"I received a box of this mix for Christmas and just now made the scones, thinking, ""um, scones?  I've never been overly impressed with them...""  I have to admit that these were absolutely delicious!  I'm not a baker but these were very easy to make, once I got the hang of flouring my work surface.  I ate two of the eight right out of the oven, and it was all I could do to save the rest for another breakfast.  Yum!"
positive,Mt Terriers love these and it's a good way for them to have a healthy snack.
negative,"From reading the title of the product I was under the impression it was 2 twin packs,<br />meaning 4 jars. It is not which makes this a horrible buy at $25.  I have no issue with JIF it is a great peanut butter."
positive,"Both my wife and I like peanut butter! But like in most things we have a different opinion. I love the extra crunchy style while she likes the creamy style. They both have that great Jif® taste and they are a good source of protein and fiber. Jif® is the top brand out there and the make a very tasty product.<br /><br />We like it on toast or crackers for a snack or for breakfast. We still even like PB&J sandwiches for a fast meal. If you like peanut butter, you'll love Jif®."
negative,Love Jif Peanut Butter and placed an order through Amazon for the 2 48oz jars for $19.00 then visited my local Walmart and found 2 40oz jars for $9.24.  I like the concept of buying through Amazon with no shipping and no tax.  But I got taken on this order.
negative,"You can buy this product at costco for 6.00 and that will get you two 48 oz jars, you do the math 9.00 a jar or 3.00 ajar.  Duh 40oz or48oz"
positive,"It is Jiff, what can I say?  What is great is that I can send this to an APO address for my contractor spouse in Afghanistan and satisfy his peanut butter cravings postage free!"
negative,Same exact product is available at Sams Club for $8.77. Wow! My Prime Membership is really paying off on this product...
positive,"If you don't like peanut butter, then why are you even looking at this item?<br /><br />Peanut Butter is delicious, and if you need 96 ounces of it at once, this is the best way to get it. Of course, I prefer Chunky, and maybe you do too, but if you need 96 ounces of Creamy peanut butter, you're at the right place.<br /><br />I looked for 96 ounces elsewhere, and though I was able to locate it, I was not able to find it for a better price. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got this 96 ounces of creamy peanut butter shipped to me in two days for free. Perfect for peanut butter shortage emergencies."
positive,"Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not ""goopy"" nor does it leave ""rice-sludge"" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."
positive,"Plus:<br />- Good deal on the price and love the convenience of free delivery.<br />- Subscribe and Save saves money.<br />- Son ate it.<br />- Not always in stock at stores so online good buy.<br />- Like the 8 ounce size containers.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />- Son gets constipated with the Rice cereal, the Oatmeal is much better.<br />- Uses to much breast milk when mixing together.<br />- If you mix by directions won't be the right consistency to feed baby.<br /><br />I would buy one package first and see how your child reacts to the Rice before you buy the pack of 6 like I did."
positive,"I love this oatmeal, and so do my kids, but recently its been harder to find.  Wal-mart in all their infinate wisdom removed it from their shelves at our local store when they did their last store makeover.  You can get it at Target, if they have it on the shelves.  Since I found it on Amazon I just buy it by the case.  My 1 and 2 year olds both love it for breakfast and I think its way better for them than regular oatmeal.  I hope amazon never stops carring it. :)"
negative,"Seriously, how does a baby cereal touted as a good choice as a first baby food contain these big NO-NO ingredients?! How can it be labeled as ""single grain""? There's no reason ""oat flour"" should contain wheat... I bought this thinking I could avoid supplementing with probiotics & dha... should have read more closely before purchasing.. Forget it, I'm going back to simply grinding up my own oatmeal.. sick of over paying for 'baby' cereal anyways..."
positive,"I have been giving this rice cereal to my now 10 month old daughter since she was 6 months old! She loves it! She loves it plain. I did buy Happy Belly brown rice cereal but she doesn't like it. Also Gerber mixes really smooth, Happy Belly is very lumpy when mixed. I will be buying this again!"
negative,"I gave this to my baby thinking the DHA and probiotic aspects were a plus. In theory, they are.<br /><br />We originally started with another brand's organic rice cereal. It listed only a few ingredients: Rice, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopherols (Vitamin E), alpha-Amylase (Enzyme), Electrolytic Iron. Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves ""normal"" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber. Wish they could use algae based DHA rather than Tuna oil."
negative,I switched from the box cereal to this particular kind thinking it was better and it made my son have diarrhea!!!!  I'm switching back to the box cereal.
negative,"Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil."
negative,"My baby really did not like eating this. I got this for the DHA thinking it would be so refined it wouldn't taste fishy. Well, my son usually takes regular rice cereal fine. I fed him this and at first he would gag and most if it came right back out. I tasted it and holy crap is it gross. It definitely has essence of fish. I tried his other rice cereal before too. It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful! I threw the rest of the can away and went back to the regular stuff."
negative,As a previous reader commented this product does have gelatin in it.  I called and Gerber said the source of the gelatin is pork.
negative,"My sweet 6 month old might have food allergies - he's thrown this up about three times now (last time I'll try with this.) He's been exclusively breastfed until now, and I've introduced sweet potato, pears, applesauce, squash, carrots and mixed veggies with no drama. I've noticed that this ceral not only contains rice, but soy, tuna, and pork-based gelatin. Going to a pediatric allergist tomorrow to check out what's going on. Poor baby! Would love to hear if anyone else has a similar story."
positive,I bought these for my food stash in case of crisis so I can't rate how they taste. The shelf life was attractive and butter & cheese are harder to preserve so this was the alternative. The problem was that 3 of the 12 cans were dented...so they were shipped that way or poor packaging was involved. We all know dented cans are what we avoid at the grocery store...
negative,"The product was advertised as resealable jars but was actually cans. The slices were mushy/soft. Its difficult to store the product once the cans are opened. The product quality,in general, is poor."
negative,"Apparently there is a second version of this, as evidenced by the ""2"", as in ""React 2"".  The 2 version is pretty bad compared to the non-2 version, IMO.  5... what a horrible idea."
negative,"As of today January 26th 2012, the description says (pack of 20) this is incorrect. Currently the unit price comes down to 1.36 a pack. Probably more expensive than the local grocery stores value 3 pack of 2.99"
negative,"Since Amazon doesn't list the ingredients, here they are: coconut milk, water, sodium metabisulfite, polysorbate 60, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and guar gum. That alone speaks volumes to me."
positive,"I tried a couple different brands; one being Thai Kitchen which is very, very thick (really good, but hard to get out of the can at times).  I wanted a lighter brand which would actually pour out of the can more easily.  I ordered this case and I am pleased with the taste (not as flavorful, but still very good)and thickness. I'll be stocked for a while...I may just give some to family.  I am quite happy with my purchase.  I have been using this in my coffee for a healthier change."
negative,"I ordered this product believing it was a good product at a great price.<br /><br />The package arrived just now via UPS. The box had been torn open and was barely being held together at the bottom by a half removed strip of packing tape. Almost all of the cans were damaged, from a single dent to a can that was nearly crushed in two.<br /><br /> I  and most consumers do not use dented cans of food or food products. I can't rate the quality of the product because I will not jeopardize my health and safety and that of my family by opening one and ingesting the contents.<br /><br />The entire case is a total loss and as it is not accepted for returns I have to just kiss my money good bye.<br /><br />I am disappointed with Amazon, it was packaged by Amazon in one of their boxes, and they won't allow me to recoup any of my loss.<br /><br />I am out $27.10 and no one is liable. BUYER BEWARE!"
positive,"Best kind of dog food I've ever used - the only kind that my dogs can eat without having ""allergies"" i.e. itchy skin and coat.  Supreme!  Reccommended for anyone tryign to give their pet a longer, healthier life."
positive,"Okay, so my cat doesn't like this alone BUT when I mix it with her other food it stops her from overeating/eating too fast and vomiting her food.  I'm all for it because of that.  No more messes on the floor after she eats too fast."
negative,Cat hates this as she will not even go near it.  I wish I did not buy 36lbs of this but oh well.
positive,"my daughter loves squeeze applesauces, but I would like her to get more variety in her diet. These are great - she loves them just as much!"
positive,"My little one was not so keen on fresh fruit right off the bat, so these came in handy.  My son got tired of the spoon you attach so he just sucks them right down.  I keep some on hand now for outings so he doesn't end up eating junk (fries, chips, etc).<br /><br />They are also great to mix with yogurt, or even milk, when ready.  Plus it is a great way to get organic fruits, especially if your local store doesn't have a great selection, like mine."
positive,"These are portable, fruit only, and they are incentive for my daughter to finish her meal before getting one -- she sucks it right down.  Also, my husband is a dentist so of course she isn't allowed to have any juice, so this fits the bill."
positive,The convence of the product is great. However the taste of the peaches are a little bitter for my daughter.
positive,"This coffee cake is so good, it was worth it to me to pay the extra money.  It's not available in supermarkets in my state, othewise it would have been a 50 percent savings-but really it is so moist and flavorful it is worth it at any price!"
positive,Another great product from Eden Foods.  This is made in Japan and only has 3 ingredients without any artificial yellow food coloring.  I didn't find it overly salty (I just rinsed with water before slicing).  They are perfect in Japanese or Korean style nori rolls.
negative,I was excited for this but disappointed when I got it. It's salty (very salty) unlike the sweeter ones from Japanese restaurants. The outside is also a thick texture that I had to remove. It wasn't as crunchy as it should be.
negative,"Even after I washed and soaked them in water for a long time, still too salty! Not good."
negative,these edible diamonds did not look shiny like the pictures shown they looked more like molded jello. I would not recommend this product if you want the diamonds to look real.
positive,"All the enchilada sauces for Old El Paso are really tasty. Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum."
positive,"after expressing my dissapointment when receiving a basket that I ordered, I received a personal email from a very kind employee expressing how sorry they were about my situation. I received full credit back, and am now aware that with fundrasiers I can get a 20%,discount.  I am truly thankful for their concern."
positive,"Not only do I own a business that makes animal accessories/treats, but I also volunteer and donate things to a local non profit no kill animal shelter.  Overall, I love this product as you can make dog treats and not worry about them melting or getting messed up before selling them or before the customer gets them home.  Yes, the dogs don't care what the treats look like, they only care about taste, and most things are tasty to them.  However, for someone who loves to make donated treats, this is a little expensive.  Not that I can find it anywhere cheaper than here, but just overall, a little more.  Just makes for having to charge a little bit more for the product you sell."
positive,My family loves this. It was always a crowd pleaser at school functions. It is so easy to make. I too can not find this on the shelves anymore. I sure wish Amazon would ship to Alaska. We really miss this dessert.
positive,I bought this as a treat for my husband because he loves anything with peanut butter.  This was amazingly good.  We made it into muffin cups and froze the individual servings.  It made 12 big servings for less then half the cost of one slice of peanut butter pie at my dh's favorite restaurant.  And he claims this is just as good.
positive,"(ASIN: B004INAQMM)  Well, here we have white fish, with Cottie's beloved cheddar cheese.  But his consumption of it is not on par with that for the tuna, not by a cat's whisker or any other measure you care to use.<br />I do not understand it.  I have fed him white fish with a myriad of other foods, including fish and shellfish, and he has usually devoured them, one and all.  But not this!  The only thing I can know for sure is that he knows it isn't tuna, which is the food he expects to experience with cheddar.<br />Cottie will eat it if very hungry, but not with the same gusto.  I need to make an attempt to find something special to put in it so he will enjoy it more than he does now.  Does anyone have any ideas for me?<br />Your takeaway is, this is a super Fancy Feast flavor, most cats will love it, but mine is a shtoonk."
positive,"These capsules go with our Espresso Italia Machine.  It makes a perfect froth with milk and the capsules each make one perfect espresso and crema.  I Love my machine, with Ghiradelli flavoring makes a Fabulous cappucinno, Better the than that star....'s company."
positive,"I had noticed this item show up in the grocery isles but the price was hardly a buy. Found this in the warehouse sale and thought I would try it, since the price was better than I was paying for the generic dressing. As usual Miracle Whip has a good product. It was lite and creamy and had a good taste, not like some of the generic  brands that taste oily or have no taste at all. Very good product just needs a price adjustment."
positive,"There's just something about Tapioca Pudding that makes me happy.  Definitely my favorite.  Until recently, I would just buy the Kozy Shack pre packaged tapioca pudding from the grocery in the refrigerated section; however, it has risen in price to the point where it is much more economical to make the cook and serve Jell-o brand, which tastes fresher and can be served warm or cold (or frozen in an ice tray similar to pudding pops (or poppers).  Also, no more worrying about the expiration date like you do with the refrigerated ones.<br /><br />When purchased from Amazon via their promo sales, you can get a package of this for .50.  Add in the price of 2 cups of milk (another .50), and you've made 4 servings of this for $1.  Definitely a bargain!"
positive,Product arrived as promised and timely.  It is great not having to shop several markets to find this product.  They always seem to be out of stock for one reason or another.
positive,"I ordered this from Amazon after reading other reviews and I'm glad I did! The pudding is really easy to make, just add skim milk and stir on medium heat for a few minutes and you have delicious pudding ready. I let it cool for a little while longer than mentioned on the pack as this makes the pudding thicker and more tasty."
positive,For the past years I used a different brand of tapioca but the process is long and tedious. My surprise is that Cook & Serve is much much faster and the taste is quite good. It can be eaten hot or cold.<br />Actually I like it cold and cover it with canned peaches. Cinnamon or bananas are good too.
positive,"The front of the box boasts, ""Low Sodium - No Cholesterol - Low Fat"". ""100% Pure Roasted Whole Grain Buckwheat"". ""Wheat & Gluten Free"".<br /><br />Ingredients: ""100% pure buckwheat - contains no additives, fortifiers or preservatives.""<br />""170 calories per 1/4 cup serving. About 3/4 cup prepared.""<br /><br />Flavor? That depends on you. The directions recommend adding bouillon but a lot of bouillon just winds up being chunks of MSG. Most recently I tried adding some jamaican jerk flavoring and it worked well. You can use this as a base, throwing other ingredients, veggies, etc. to turn this into your own creation. This cooks up in maybe fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Only drawback, which may not be a nuisance to you, is that preparation as directed uses two pans, one to boil the liquid ingredients and a second to griddle up the kasha with egg coating before combining the two into one pan. That's not enough of a drawback to prevent me from stocking up on more Wolff's Kasha."
negative,"For those of us buying Diet soft drinks, the sweetener used often becomes a vital piece of information. Why even bother offering diet tonic for sale if you don't tell us this? Many diet tonics are STILL made with saccharin (tastes AWFUL). We want to know BEFORE we order."
positive,"I saw the review that gave a 1 star without actually receiving the product.  While I agree with that review that the contents should be listed, a simple web search revealed that this product is in fact (an all important point by the way) sweetened with Aspartame.<br /><br />If you are someone like me that likes tonic with their beverages but simply cannot stand diet tonic that is readily available due to the use of Saccharin as a sweetener (which makes me literally ill in tonic) then this *may* be a product for you.<br /><br />Is it as good as regular tonic (Canada Dry, Shwepps, store brands, or the premiums like Fever Tree)? - NO.<br /><br />Is it a livable substitute if you want to avoid the hundreds of calories? - YES.  It does however put a damper on your Gin or Vodka if you buy Premium brands.<br /><br />There are other Aspartame-sweetened diet tonic brands available that I have not tried due to the enormous shipping costs involved."
positive,While I wouldn't call this a health food they are healthier than most snack foods so I don't worry as much when my kids eat a bag of these.<br /><br />The taste is a bit more mild than Cheetos so if you are hooked on cheetos these might not do.  I know when we open a bag around here no one can stop eating them until they are gone.<br /><br />Here are the nutrition facts comparing them to Cheetos Natural White Cheddar Cheese Puffs<br /><br />  Cheetos WC  Smart Puff<br />Calories 150  130<br />Fat Calories 80  60<br />Fat  9g  6g<br />Sodium  290mg  50mg<br /><br />Not a huge difference and everything else is close.  I'm sure regular cheetos would have higher numbers.
positive,"My kids LOVE these.  We are a gluten free family.  Snacks that work with our diet are hard to find.  Smart puffs are not only tasty, they also use REAL ingredients.  Perfect for a restricted diet."
positive,"Great snack for whole family.  Everyone likes them, from the 2-year old to the teens, grandma too.  The most popular (in this house) of all the Roberts snacks."
positive,"Delicious, no problem w/ arriving stale. Nice size for lunches -- my kids and I like them more than cheetos. And no msg, or food coma feelings after eating them -- nice and light, satisfying."
positive,"I have always loved cheese puffs but finding the perfect one was difficult.<br /><br />Cheeto's ""Dangerously Cheesy"" Cheese Puffs were disgusting. I do not think their ""cheese"" is even real cheese. I wanted something plainer and healthier for myself.<br /><br />I have tired smaller companies but they always ended getting bankrupt or discontinuing their plaining cheese puffs.<br /><br />Finally, I tried Smart Puffs from my local supermarket. I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!"
positive,"Yum Yum!!! I bought a case of these for a camping trip my daughter was going on with her cross country team...they LOVED them. Good flavor, texture, and a nice substitute for other cheesey flavored snacks."
positive,"This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets.  I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim.  Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs."
positive,"I was expecting the Cheetos like snacks that are in the Chaos mix (which is quite yummy), but that's not what these are.  They are thick and airy like Jax, not hard a crunchy like Cheetos.  They taste good, but if you're looking for crunchy, this isn't it.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they sell the Cheetos like stuff that's in Chaos by itself?"
negative,I love Pirate's booty aged white cheddar and thought these would be just as good- but was I WRONG! They are awful-no pleasant crunch-no flavor at all! I am going to try the other Pirate Booty flavors in a variety pack and hope they are not as foul as these. Don't know how they got these so wrong when the aged white cheddar is so DELICIOUS!!!
positive,"I am gluten free so I am always looking to have grab and go items available.  My kids love these puffs, and so do I.<br /><br />Lots of them for a reasonable calorie count."
negative,"Pros: Low Cal. Cons: Hardly any flavor. Seriously, I taste nothing but ""puff"". They get stale fast, and the bag always tears when opening. Always! Very annoying. Sorry, if you want cheddar flavor, look elsewhere. These remind me of rice crackers."
negative,"Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs.  Enough said about taste.  Here's the issue -->  Get a bag, look at the nutritional information and ask yourself ""How many calories are in a bag of these puffs?""  Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of ""about 1"" servings.  In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz.  So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag.  I consider this devious at the very least.  Now, is that not so SMART or what??"
negative,"I really hesitate to leave a negative review since we love the chips, but both of the last 2 shipments were destroyed.  Both boxes were marked ""received in damaged condition"" - from the shipper.  I've never received any other damaged products from Amazon, so I made the mistake of ordering the chips again, thinking it was a fluke. Evidently not. Will not buy these from Amazon again."
positive,These  were recommended by my nutritionist as a portion and calorie controlled snack. One bag is filling and satisfying!
negative,"Boy was I dissapointed in these babies.  I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly. I love pirates booty, that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to.  These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty, no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money.  So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount.  Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack, unless your into eating flavorless food."
positive,"I tried these after having Pirate's Booty one day.  Anyway I prefer this taste over Cheetos Curls.  The taste is a little milder, but in a good way.  Besides the taste these are 10X less bad for you than Cheetos.  The only bad thing is that you can kill the bag in 2 or 3 sittings and not even realize it."
positive,"For me - these are great - they're light and crunchy without the bright orage residue of others.  My baby loves these (she's not been spoiled by others kinds) and my older boys don't care for them.  they prefer other kinds of chips.  I think if you start them very young or try them later once the kids are old enough to grasp the idea of nutrition - they'll be a big hit.  I personally prefer the taste of these over other brands and other types of salty, crunchy snacks."
positive,I personally love the pirate's booty but I decided to give this a try. My family loves it! The smell isn't the best but to eat a bag full of not-guilty puffs (only 130 calories! not bad for a whole bag)I would say that evens it out. I'd get it again... but I have to try the others flavors first.
positive,"I thought these little cheese puffs were great. I don't think they are necessarily a health food, but a tasty snack."
positive,These were my kids favorite.  No orange mess and a light crunchy texture.
positive,"Robert's Smart Puffs are not fake orange-colored like the big corporate name brands.  Very cheesy and oh so delicious.  Try them!  You won't be sorry.  But be warned, they are seriously addictive. :)"
positive,"These are very tasty for all the reasons the below reviewer cited - a lot like cheetoes, but without artificial additives. I don't know why you'd cite carbs as a reason to take off a star - you sort of, you know, need them to live."
positive,"Corn meal never tasted this good.<br /><br />These Smart Puffs are less salty, contain no dusty orange coloring and don't leave your hands and teeth looking like you ate a ball of fake orange cheese.  They melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to a Cheetos addict to let them see what a more natural like product tastes like.<br /><br />These contain real dairy ingredients and whey, for those who are allergic to milk.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price.  At over thirty bucks a case these are quite expensive.  Grab these when they go on sale for under twenty bucks."
positive,"I purchased these as a treat for my kid's lunchbox. She loves they dayglow yellow puffs. She liked these better. Sadly, so did I. : )"
negative,It pisses me off seeing pirates booty coming up as a VEGAN item when its obviously not.<br />The seller needs to learn to label/tag their products correctly.
negative,"I've bought these in the grocery store before, but apparently I'd forgotten how bland they are. There are better things like this out there, and cheaper too, so I will not buy these again."
negative,These are like eating cardboard I am sorry to be negative but they are not as good not even as the reviews have said.Wasted my money by believing in the reviews.
negative,"I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they ""weren't bad"".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items."
positive,"I love Jivealime! It is citrusy, crunchy and sweet - with no sugar added! Totally satisfies my sweet tooth without the guilt :) This all natural fruit snack is my new favorite mid-morning go-to."
negative,I was excited to try these but I did not enjoy the flavor at all. The lime was too tart and overpowered the pineapple flavor. Now I'm stuck with 11 bags of a product that I won't eat!
positive,I like the Funky Monkey and would gladly buy more. I just cannot justify the cost ($38/pound).
positive,Wow this is great coffee! We love the mellow taste. Normally we drink a dark roast but this is very good and has a nice after taste that we like. Nice and smooth. I am going to try other blends from this company. Happy to have found it here on Amazon.
positive,"This mix makes the most excellent cupcakes/cakes, you would never know it was gluten free.  It's very easy to make but one strange thing happens when you are beating it. The batter seems to climb up the beaters, but it doesn't matter, the end product is a wonderful treat for people who can't eat gluten-typically cake mixes are very dry, however, this one seems to be perfect!  My hats off to Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix!!!"
positive,"I have been gluten free for about a year.  I miss eating what everyone else eats and dessert was one of those things.  I made this cake and frosted it with a non-dairy topping and added fruit on top.  It was soo good and everyone else liked it too.  There are so many ways to change out this cake mix by adding ingredients. That's why I orded a pack of 4.  If you are trying to go gluten free, try this product. If you didn't tell everyone it was gluten free they really wouldn' know.  I love ordering from Amazon using Prime as there are no shipping costs and the products come right away."
positive,"Many of the other GF mixes out there cost more and make less than this mix.  Now that we can use egg (outgrowing allergies), this mix is an option for us.  I was surprised the first time I made it to see it actually makes a complete 9x13 or 2 rounds!  My 6 year old was thrilled to have a layer cake for his birthday.<br /><br />We shared the cake with family that aren't typically GF, and even Grandpa liked it!<br /><br />We look forward to using this mix with the GF Cake Doctor book for lots of other ideas on how to spruce up a plain vanilla cake.  In the meantime, we are enjoying with just frosting added!"
positive,"I used to pay high prices for the Betty Crocker brand of Gluten Free cake mix but have now discovered that this Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix is just as good and priced much lower. I use it for cakes but also make peanut butter cookies using this as one of the main ingredients.  They come out so moist that you would think they were ""regular cookies""."
positive,"cant even tell this was gluten free! a must buy! moist and delicious. and dosent crumble like most glutenn free mixes, u can even add stuff to this mix for more flavor. great mix! good job bobs red mil!"
positive,Very good product.  Nice flavor.  Makes a whole 9 X 13 cake unlike other cake mixes which only make a one layer or half the amount of this mix.
positive,"Sort of followed the directions, mixed in a Kitchenaid stand mixer with the K paddle.  After beating the eggs and adding the cake mix, i dropped in a half cup of soft butter flavor crisco and creamed it in.  Then I added a half cup of unsweetened vanilla soy milk. Mixed as directed.  Baked in a dutch oven with the lid on in my kitchen oven @350F with the convection fan running.  Cooked to 200F~210F internal temp.  Just brilliant very close match to how I remember a wheat flour cake tasting.  Great crumb.  Highly recommended. As I'm a fan of hot Rooibos tea without sugar and no sugar added pie fillings the sweetness was perfect for me.  Very easy to add sugar or Splenda to increase the sweetness.  I suspect that the older reviews may (educated guess on my part) reflect an older formulation of this product.  I got my four pack in March 2012."
positive,"I wasn't happy with this product unless it was made with real eggs, then it was still a bit dense and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer Bob's Red Mill's awesome chocolate cake.  Both benefit from mixing in some extra vanilla.  So, not to be avoided, but I don't use it much."
negative,"We are very new to baking and eating gluten free. This cake was easy to bake. It did not get eaten because of the lack of taste. It did not taste like a cake. It was not sweet at all. It was more like wheat bread. Half the cake got thrown out. I think we needed to add ""something"" to the mix to make it sweet and it would have been a hit with my kids. I personally would NOT recommend unless you know how to add stuff to a recipe."
positive,"This cake mix was all the things that a cake should be moist, soft, finely textured and delicious.  If there was one complaint to be made it would be that it was a litte too sweet for my personal taste but nobody else thought this way.  I bought this for my son but gave it to some gluten eaters who said that they could not tell the difference and wanted to eat more!  This makes it a winner in my book."
negative,"I found this mix to have a strong bean taste to it.  I tried it a couple of times.  First just the way the mix says, which I did not like the taste at all nor did my hubby.  The 2nd time I added some vanilla to the mix in which did give it a bit of a better taste and was something my hubby said he would eat.  For me over all just to much bean of a flavor and I will never by it again."
positive,These have become our new office addiction.  We have gone through about 8 bags in a couple of weeks.  Yummy
positive,"I bought this for my gluten intolerant girlfriend.<br />Normally, I do not care for the taste and/or texture of GF items.<br />These brownies were very good, I'd buy them again."
positive,"Here's what it says over the label-  Total Carbs 41, Fiber -5, Protected Carbs -31 = digestible carbs 5<br /><br />Now, what the hell are ""protected carbs""?  No one knows.  This is a term that the company coined themselves.  And they don't really give any explaination either.  When you go on their website they claim that these ""protected carbs"" are not digestible.  Really?  Well then why don't you go ahead and tell us what exactly they are then?<br /><br />I asked 2 nutritionists about this and they both told me that they are familiar with Dreamfields Pasta and both stated it is a scam that uses tricky wording on their labels!  One nutritionist told me that her patients would have no insulin spike but then 4 hours after eating the pasta suddenly it would spike drastically.  She believes all this pasta does is slow the digestion to a point where it tricks people for a few hours into thinking they are taking in only 5 carbs.  Both doctors said that the real net carb content of this pasta is actually around 36.  Which is still less than other pastas, but not by much.  I eat this pasta as I am not diabetic and it does taste good and have less carbs, but I have diabetic relatives and I would never cook it for them.  When I'm done with the dreamfields I have left over I'm going to try Carba-Nada pasta...which isn't really low carb, but it's lower than Dreamfields and they don't have tricky nutrition labels.  Haven't tried it yet though so I can't comment on it any more than that."
positive,"This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!"
positive,If you are not into the texture of whole wheat pasta....try Dreamfields Pasta.  It has the Good Housekeeping Seal!  You can't go wrong because each serving has 5 grams of net usable carbs which is so much healthier for your body than regular pasta.  Check it out for yourself and smile.  :  )
negative,"It tastes great but doesn't stand up to scientific testing on its claim of ""low-carb"" or their other marketing.  Dreamfield's is a fraud.  Just search for National Institute of Health on their findings for this pasta and its affect on blood.  In part ""In 10 people without diabetes, the Dreamfields pasta product we purchased did not result in an improved glucose excursion when compared with a commercially available traditional pasta product as would have been expected based upon the company's claim.""<br /><br />Do your own research folks!  Especially if you have Type 2 Diabetes!"
positive,I buy a case of this pasta every year at Christmas time for my mom. She is a diabetic and can't get this product locally.  She loves the flavor and texture of this pasta and it has little impact on her blood sugar so it allows her to have the pasta dishes she loves without wreaking havoc on her diabetes.  Great product.  I've been using this pasta exclusively for the past 8 years.  It's been a great way to remain on my low carb program and enjoy my favorite pasta dishes!
positive,"My wife is a pasta lover and diabetic. Although we do not count the carbs as 5g (that would be a free food) we count it as 2 servings (30gs instead of all 42g). Our dietitian says preliminary investigations look promising but the jury is still out regarding the amount of carbohydrate effect on blood sugar levels of diabetics (types 1 and 2) but that it is a good source of fiber. Good tasting and good source of fiber, Dreamfield's Pasta in moderation, works very well for us."
positive,"First the taste - I'm a huge pasta lover and this tastes just as good to me as any pre-made pasta I've ever had. It's also completely filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I'm pre-diabetic and so far seem to have elevated blood sugar only in the mornings, so this may not be relevant to people with full diabetes, but here are the results of my tests. An evening meal including a double portion of Dreamfields and 30 grams of carbs from another dish gave me a modest rise in blood sugar, about what I'd expect from a 40-50 gram meal. On another occasion when I ate a double portion of Dreamfields alone in the late morning, my blood sugar had dropped slightly six hours later. I had read a couple of people complaining that they got high readings eight hours or so after eating Dreamfields but this doesn't seem to happen to me.<br /><br />Extra fiber is always another plus. With the lowered carbs Dreamfields should also be lower calorie but there don't seem to be any official claims for that.<br /><br />Again according to my readings: don't overcook it, reheat it, or cook it in something acidic like tomato sauce or the carb-hiding effect will be lost. (It's fine to add tomato sauce after the pasta is cooked.)<br /><br />The only drawback is the price, but it's well worth it to be able to eat pasta and not be concerned about the carbs."
positive,"This pasta is great, you would never know it is low carb. It is the only pasta we eat!"
positive,"This is the best healthy pasta option on the market.  Taste great, has high fiber content!  With the economy the way it is, you cannot beat the value of pasta."
negative,"I care less about carbs than I do calories for weight control, and when I went to the Dreamfields website it gives a very confusing and evasive explanation of the number of calories per pack. So I emailed for an explanation and the explanation was equally evasive. It says to essentially to forget the FDA required nutritional label of 190 calories because you will only be digesting 129 calories. So I asked and they later confirmed that yes you are actually putting 190 calories in your mouth, but I guess you have to accept their opinion that you only will absorb 129. I keep a journal of all calories, so do I document 190 or 129? If it was only 129 why would they be required to put 190? To me it sounds like a game, the same game they appear to be playing with the carb count. Unless it is otherwise univerally accepted by the scientific community I say it has 190 calories."
positive,"I was surprised that a ""modified"" pasta could taste so good. I'm not diabetic, but want to eat healthier where I can, so this pasta peaked my interest. I cooked it very simply - just added a good olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried marjoram after it was boiled (slightly undercooked) - very good. I could see where you might not stay full for long with the reduced carbs, but if you want to be able to eat pasta this is a good one to try."
negative,"I tried this pasta because it was on sale at my local store, I usually buy the discount-priced store brands. And I was willing to excuse the slightly higher price (even with a coupon) on the premise I was eating 'heathy'.<br /><br />Well, I found out that after eating a dish of this stuff, I felt hungry again by dinner. I have fairly good diet control, so I assumed it was the low-carb construction. Having not eaten a low-carb pasta before, I was theorizing on it's effects.<br /><br />I then did some independent web research on this suspicion. And other people also had the same experience after having eaten this product. It does not leave you full. This defeats the purpose of eating.<br /><br />Buying this product at any price was a waste if I was not nourished. I might as well only had been imagining about eating. And considering that I buy pasta to be economically frugal in today's oh-so trying times, this is one brand which won't be cooked up again."
negative,"Google ""propylene glycol"" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's ""pure"" and then there's ""not so much""....."
positive,"For clean teeth, wanted to add a crunchy biscuit to my dog's meals. This fit the bill. Smaller size means fewer broken pieces."
positive,They're a little hard for small dogs - I actually have to break them up for my Shih tzu & Pekinese but they love them.
negative,"I know this should be a review of the actual product, but I want people to be aware of my situation. I normally trust amazon and would recommend most products through amazon.com. However, the condition I received this box of treats was unacceptable. I purchased what I believed to be a new, unopened box of dog treats, but what I received was an open box with tape all around the sides, including where the ""tear here"" tab was torn off. I can't tell if any treats are missing, but this is definitely not a ""new"" box of treats."
positive,"Our vet recommends--nags--that we brush our dogs' teeth. Our dogs, on the other hand, think that's an awful idea and are not the least cooperative. Therefore, we try to give them treats that might have some benefit to their unbrushed teeth. Our puppy gobbles these down, no matter the flavor, but our senior dog (who is medium-fussy) will only eat the chicken. In general, she will not eat bacon or beef dog food, and apparently that applies to treats as well. So...in our house, 1 paw up, 1 paw down."
positive,"This is great pepperoni, but it's not for everyone. If you're tired of buying the limp tasteless mush they package precut in bags at the grocery store, this is what you should buy. It's good seared, baked, and raw. We've served it frequently with cheese and crackers. Many guests (but not all) appreciate the bold flavor. For a pack of three and with a subscription, this price can't be beat. It'll last you a good long while.<br /><br />(Just make sure to cut off the casing before eating!)"
positive,"Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them ""raw"" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever."
positive,"How convenient it is to have a big stick of pepperoni on hand? Very! Now all I have to do is slice what I want for my pizza, chunk it for a salad or in pasta. It works for everything. Spaghetti sauce gets an extra kick with pepperoni added. I'm still working on things to add it to."
positive,I ordered this product and absolutely love it! I will definitely order again and recommend to others. I have been on weight watchers and was really missing my pepperoni when I found this... 12 slices = 2 points :-)<br />I saw a few reviews that said this was not great and I'm here to say that's totally not my opinion. I think that it has even more flavor than regular pepperoni.<br />Has a great spice to it and works great to make a flat bread low point pizza without feeling like your skipping on taste.
positive,"I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that ""practice makes perfect"".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days."
positive,"It's definitely good on pizza. My advice is to slice thin, as thin as you can make it. This pepperoni is GREASY!"
positive,"Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great ""seasoning"" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture."
positive,"I ordered 3 sticks and was pleasantly surprised that they arrived (in Egypt) about two weeks later.  I got them home and immediately opened one because I have been craving pepperoni since I got here three months ago.  The flavor is awesome.  It's very spicy, but in a good way.  Heat in the microwave for a few seconds to get some of the extra grease out of it."
positive,"This pepperoni is a fixture at our family New Year's Eve party, and local stores have stopped carrying it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a competitive price!"
positive,This Old World Pepperoni is worlds better in taste than your standard pre-sliced Pepperoni in a bag found in most grocery store which is relatively flavorless and uninteresting in my opinion.  We bought this at SamsClub for years before they stopped carrying it and is great for our home made pizzas.<br />The Pepporoni is seasoned well and makes all the difference in home cooking!
negative,"Those people who wrote positive reviews on this pepperoni are definitely their workers doing their job behind the computer.<br />These smell bad, taste bad and looks bad.<br />I love pepperoni, I love them cooked but preferably eat it raw.<br />They should be licking finger good. But Nope! Not these.<br />It has that after taste and before taste. Very strong beefy like taste.<br />Like that other one star review, it smells awful but not that bad when eating.<br />It is edible but definitely not enjoying ones.<br /><br />I'm gonna try to put these on pizza and have it cooked all the way.<br />Or else We're gonna throw away 6 packs of these."
negative,"The first thing I noticed after opening the sealed bag was a godawful smell. It really slaps you in the face.  The taste, well, it's not as bad as the smell, things things are edible, but I can't really say I would enjoy eating them.  The good news is that after eating about a few of them, it totally killed my appetite."
positive,"Great variety pack, Enough to let you know which teas you like and to order in the future. Great product."
negative,"i was expecting a, packaged,  Tea Sampler package from ""k-Cup"".. not a bunch of single,random k-cups throw into an amazon box. some of the k-cups were damaged and already had holes in them. this is not what i was expecting at all."
positive,"There were some singles, but lots of the same black tea and breakfast tea (black tea). No Celestial Seasons tea.  Not as much variety as I hoped for."
positive,Other reviews I read warned of having too many of one type in the box.  Not true in my case - the box had a very nice variety of teas.  there were a couple that had duplicates but that was kind of wahtI was expecting.  I am very satisfied with this transaction.
positive,"My box didn't include Sleepytime and Orange Spice, and I wanted to try both of those before buying a whole box so that was a little disappointing. Other than that, I'm pleased with the variety for the price and accomplishing my objective with this sampler."
negative,"What a disappointment..the picture shows many different varieties of teas which is exactly what I wanted but which was NOT what got delivered.  I received NO mint, peppermint, chamomile, peach, raspberry, mandrin orange spice and no southern sweet half and half!  I did recieved mostly earl grey, black tea and green tea along with way too many chai teas and I don't even like chai tea!  If I can return this shipment I will and I certainly wound NOT recommend this to anyone who wants the variety displayed in the picture....you won't get it!"
negative,I ignored the reviews because I figured it would not be that bad. Was I ever wrong. Very disappointed in the horrible selection. Not even one iced tea. Not one. And half of the regular tea was Green Tea. What a joke. Do yourself a favor and just move on. I wish I did.<br /><br />Amazon you should be ashamed of this product. You need to seriously consider how this process works.
negative,"I ordered this to try a varity of samples to see which flavors I would like, instead I get only 4 flavors there you'd be no more than two f a kind to get a good cross sampling of flavors."
negative,I was very disappointed when I received the product(s).  The 35 K-cups were loose in the packaging box.  The product is described as a pack of 35. I am uncomfortable that the K-cups are not in a sealed box from the manufacturer.  How do I know these cups were not discarded leftovers from serveral variety packs?  I doubt I'll use the K-cups and there are no returns.  Buyer beware.
negative,"Although the title doesn't say it, the product description states multiple times that this product is 100% decaf.  Of what I received, I counted 9 of the 35 to actually be decaf (25%).  Looks like a nice selection of teas, but it's not all decaf.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Update - 30 DEC:  it appears that the product description has been updated."
negative,i recieved a different flavor than what i ordered but tried it and it was terrible<br />i wished i returned it at the get go<br />only 12 more ugh bottles left
positive,"Since our local grocery stores no longer carry 'red' pistachios, I went on the internet to find them and fortunately, I discovered that Superior Nut Company has them available to purchase online.  I ordered the 5 pound bag and they arrived quickly, were very fresh, well packaged and yes, they were actually red.  We have been enjoying these and when they are close to being fully consumed, I will not hesitate to re-order from Superior."
positive,"This product is what all should be using instead of the refined sugar that is everywhere. It's sweeter, you use less and it's easy to store and keep. The seller of this item got the package with 3 bags to me in record time and for that alone deserves 5 stars. Highly recommended to all"
negative,"This product states on the label ""Fructose FRUIT Sugar,"" but the fructose in this product is in fact not made from fruit; it is made from corn.  Corn is not a fruit product.  I think it is deceptive of NOW to label their fructose sugar as ""Fructose Fruit Sugar"" when it's not."
negative,"This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was ""mercury is less than 400 parts per billion"". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process."
positive,"I usually use Only Natural Pet Easy Raw dehydrated food, however I wanted to try Honest Kitchen's brand just to see how it compared, it looked & smelled like a pile of mush grass.  My dogs avoided it like the plague even my little girl who eats anything that is not nailed down.  I was panicking thinking I just wasted a huge chunk of money on something my fur kids won't eat when the Mail<br />Man rang and my delayed shipment of Only Natural brand freeze-dried chicken & beef patties came.  I was soooo happy!!!! I ripped open a bag of chicken, took a sniff, OMG it smelled so good!!!  I quickly crumbled the patty into the pile of green mush and my dogs scarfed it down in 5 minutes.  This food is so great & convenient.  Since it is expensive, I'm going to use it as a flavor enhancer in combination with other raw foods.  The Honest Kitchen food is very nutritious and easy to rehydrate.  However, it needs to be enhanced or combined with other ingredients such as meats (beef,turkey,chicken,buffalo, etc). I also add fish oil for shiney coats and sometimes add a raw egg as well."
negative,"I have tried several of the premix bases for dog food. My dog is on a raw diet. When this bag of premix arrived, I was terribly disappointed. It was like receiving a bag of mulched grass. There was very little fruits or vegetables as claimed on the label. It smells like a bag of fresh cut hay. From the look and smell, it's almost all alfalfa. There are other premixed bases available that are much better. I am mixing it with other mixes to make it more appealing to my dog."
positive,"I drink multiple different flavors of Nuun all day long. This is a nice refreshing, not too sweet flavor. When I race and will only have water, I use this for a flavor change."
positive,"i have not had other panda flavors, but i do really like the blueberry licorice.  good ingredients such as molasses, wheat flour, blueberry puree to name a few.  like a good licorice, it's soft and chewy.  there's roughly about 40 pieces in a 6 oz bag.  although i usually don't like black licorice because of it's strong taste, the licorice flavor here is more subtle.  i highly enjoy and recommend this licorice treat for a quick snack.  it's good!"
positive,Great tasting licorice the best I have found on the market in this flavor.  And it is more healthy then regular licorice by far!!
positive,"First of all, let me start this review by stating just how much I love Panda Licorice. Period. They are the best brand of licorice, hands down, in my humble opinion. This particular breed of licorice - their new blueberry flavor - doesn't disappoint. You taste that beautiful blueberry puree, and it just makes you smile. I ordered the six pack in the baggie, and I am already halfway done with them, if that gives you a sense of just how much of a licorice fan I am. Yum."
negative,"Eight dollars a can for an item that normally sells for around four dollars a can is a total rip off. This product was available from Amazon a few months back, but hasn't been in inventory in recent months. Regardless, you can purchase at your local grocery for a little over $4 and on-line in quantity for under that. The price this vendor is attempting to charge is indicative of their lack of business ethics - and Amazon's as well, for letting this vendor do business through their site. The product is wonderful, the vendor is evidently a crook."
positive,"Have always loved the product - great taste/not as sweet as all the other flavors....<br />HOWEVER, it did not go unnoticed that the 10 oz. can is now 9 0z. for the same price as the 10 oz. can........even though the actual can is the same size.....did they think we wouldn't notice??????"
positive,I have been drinking this coffee for over 25 years and still like it best.  I was dismayed to find it no longer sold in food stores I frequent.<br /><br />The postage is too high and am shopping around for a store still carrying this coffee.
negative,"My wife loves this product and has enjoyed it for years. The product is<br />the only coffee I will drink as I am not a coffee drinker.<br /><br />Having said this, the price it is offered at is NOT so good.<br /><br />We have purchased it for under three dollars a tin and regularly<br />buy it, not on sale, for three twenty-eight a tin as of 12/2010.<br /><br />I consider the previous reviewer's comments legitimate as I can<br />get a better deal at the local ""Stuff Mart"". It is a deal once it<br />gets below three dollars a tin."
positive,My first experience with 3in1 San Mig Coffee was in Davao City Philippines. I dont drink much coffee but tried this at the hotel I was staying and found the taste to be a great satisfying morning drink. I brought some home and plan to introduce my employees to this quick and easy idea for those who have to have coffee in the mornings or throughout the day. Quick and easy and satisfying.
positive,"I'm very pleased with this purchase, my mother and my nephew love picking marshmallows from cereal. These taste just the same, and I loved the price. Thanks! :]"
positive,"My husband is the one who found out about these and we just HAD to get them. It makes all of your cereals..well...magically delicious! It tastes just like the lucky charms marshmallows. They come in individual bags just like shown on the picture and they are all crunchy little marshmallows, no problems with them being stale here! We will be buying more when we run out."
positive,They taste great when opened then 5 minutes later stale and stick together. Not as good as the ones in the cereal.
negative,"This tea is ok, it's not bitter but it is so disappointing. I have been searching for a jasmine oolong that I had in a Japanese restaurnat that was so good. This tea is not it. You can't even really smell the jasmine in this tea. The tea I had at the restaurant was a golden color with a slightly sweet taste and aroma of Jasmine. I have bought so many teas trying to find it. The saleslady at the fancy tea shop assured me that this was the tea I have been looking for. NOT! Years ago, I had a manager that came from Japan and she took me to a restaurant which her family and friends frequented and I have not had tea like that since. HELP, I want to enjoy tea like that in my own home."
positive,"Yummy but NOT frothy... this is purposed for Latte Cafe machines usually at gas stations like QT/RaceTrack/etc.<br /><br />Having purchased this previously at a Closeout Store, I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a decent price. I use it like ""brand name la-di-da"" French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage that comes in those cute little rectangular tins for a higher price. Just as good and somewhat cheaper, depending on selling price (Amazon cheapest = 6.19 a bag). This size is equivalent to FOUR tins purchased at local stores. Those la-di-das on clearance cost about $2.50 EACH.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: Use 1.5 - 2.0 Tablespoons French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage Mix per 8ozs of Hot Water and Stir.<br />Psst, no matter how much or fast you stir, it will not be frothy :)"
negative,"Earlier this year, the FDA enacted a new rule forcing companies to take the gluten-free label from anything that has more than 20 ppm gluten.  (I'm looking at you, Arrowhead Mills and Bob's Red Mill.)<br /><br />However, you can be right at 20 ppm, which makes a lot of celiacs sick, and still label yourself, ""gluten free"".  (The rule should have said, ""less than 20 ppm"", not ""20 ppm or less"".)<br /><br />This is where Amazon is fantastic--they made the company list the gluten in this, so we know it's NOT gluten free.  (I have yet to find a Hain's food product that was actually gluten free, although some of them are legally gluten free.  Look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid, even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf.)<br /><br />Pacific Rice Milk and Whole Foods' store brands of rice milk are gluten free, though.  Buy those instead."
positive,"Rice Dream has a light, refreshing taste. You can drink this alone unlike soy milk which only tastes good when combined with other foods like cereal.<br /><br />The price here is outrageous though, especially for only 8oz containers."
negative,"Tiny boxes of rice milk averaging $1.00 a box. It also had a weird taste. I buy Rice Dream rice milk all of the time and we like it, but these tiny drink boxes taste weird. A total rip off."
negative,The price for this item is three times what you would pay at the store.
negative,"I like Rice Dream. This, however, is too high a price for too small a container. Smaller containers waste more packaging materials per ounce of product too!"
negative,"The switch to organic is a good step, but Rice Dream rice milk is chalky and too sugary - 23 grams of carbohydrates per serving!  That's close to the sugars in a soda.  A person could get a sugar high or go into sugar shock (if diabetic) with this level of sugar.  I finally stumbled upon unsweetened Almond Breeze vanilla which has 4 grams of carbs and So Delicious vanilla coconut milk which has 9 grams of carbs.  I still have half a dozen sugary rice milks that I'm watering down with homemade almond milk just to reduce the terrifying sugar level.  Unsweetened Almond Breeze tastes smooth and nutty, and regular so Delicious both tastes smooth and somewhat coconutty.  You can even mix the two and even add some rice milk, but rice milk alone is too high in sugars."
negative,You can get a better deal purchasing a carton from Walmart or an organic store (Roots) nearby.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer.  Amazon should carry the 64 ounce containers!!!
positive,"Rice Dream is a great alternative to cow's milk.  It is lactose free and has a great, somewhat sweet, and refreshing taste.  My wife and I are addicted to it.  It is also shelf safe and does not have to be refrigerated until opened.  Rice Dream is perfect for travel, camping, and fishing trips.<br /><br />Peter<br />Memphis, TN"
negative,"I drink Rice Dream rice milk every single day, but the 8 oz packages are too wasteful and expensive."
negative,"We like this item, but wish that it was available in larger sizes, these are way too expensive......"
positive,"so glad I found this product. I'm lactose intolerant, and regular milk grosses me out anyway. I've tried soy, but don't like the taste. This rice dream rice milk truly is a dream :) SO glad I found/tried it. Love it to eat with my wheaties."
positive,I send a small Rice Dream box daily with my 5 year old to kindergarten.  Thanks for giving him and his allergies a safe alternative.
positive,"This rice drink is healthy and delicious. A great dairy and soy alternative, this rice drink is great to drink by itself, to use in baking, and to use as a creamer in tea and coffee drinks."
negative,"Thank you, Amazon for listing barley in Rice Dream's ingredients.  It is sad that Rice Dream does not list the barley on their packages.  My 15-month-old son has to be on a gluten free diet.  Rice Dream was sabotaging our efforts.  As a thank you to Amazon.com, I purchase cases of Pacific Rice milk from Amazon.  I also save money from purchasing it online than locally.  We have enjoyed Rice Dream for years but if you need to be on a gluten free diet, this is not the product for you.  Purchase Pacific Rice milk."
positive,"I bought this tea as a way of helping to regulate my system and perform a cleanse. Wow, this tea is gentle, and certainly does the trick. I highly recommend to anyone wanting to perform a cleanse, and enjoys the taste of chamomile tea."
negative,"This extract has a very strong alcohol aroma, so much so that it is difficult to discern any pistachio flavor. You might as well use a liquer instead- you'd probably get a better flavor."
positive,"These are nice and at $28, a good value.  They taste yummy and are pretty satisfying.  They're vegan, preservative free, and have only a half gram of monounsaturated fat each.  My only issue is that the calories are a bit high and the nutrients a bit low.  Each (appx) 5x3"" cracker is 70 calories and has only 2 grams of fiber.  Aside from phosphorous and magnesium (6 and 4% RDA respectively) the only health benefit is 2 grams each of protein and iron.  For a cracker, they are pretty filling but it's still easy to go through a LOT of calories in a short time.  With a thick, no-sugar spread a couple of these would probably suffice for a heavy breakfast or light lunch."
positive,"I've been a Ryvita fan for a number of years, and the Fruit Crunch version is my favorite. They are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth (and keep me from making a disasterous vending machine raid) and filling enough so that I can get by eating 1 or 2. I don't need any spreads or goop on the cracker....they are fine without. Anyway, I thought I'd try these Fruit & Seed Crunch crackers since amazon had a Friday promotion. The currants are much smaller and not even obvious vs larger pieces in the Fruit Crunch that add some pleasant chewiness. The seeds aren't plentiful...these taste more like a sweetened rye cracker. If given the choice, I'd still choose Fruit Crunch over Fruit & Seed Crunch."
negative,"Not what I expected, nothing like the illustration on the package.  I have enjoyed Ryvita products previously, but will not purchase this item again. Two seeds and one raisin per brick of corrugated meal do not make the pain of eating one of these worthwhile. Food should not break into shards and try to stab you. Also, the image suggests that the product is toasty golden.  No evidence given of fireblasted blowtorch charring. Tag suggestions: good god I can't feel the roof of my mouth."
positive,"These are awesome!! Whole grain, sweet, but not much sugar. So as a diabetic, I am happy, happy, happy.<br />A friend (not a diabetic) had one, then two, then three. He begged to buy a box from my secret stash as even in Seattle I can't seem to find a store that stocks them as regular merchandise. They are perfect to pack for a day trip, a late night snack, or any other time something crunchy seems appropriate. Yummmm!"
positive,"My first taste and I was disappointed.  I and a daughter have gone through 4 boxes at this point and this is what I've found:<br /><br />Taste is like those huge pillows of shredded wheat cereal pounded down into a hard, thick crackery crispbread.  Not even close to the amount of seeds in the picture and maybe 1 or 2 currants per crispbread.  The added brown sugar gives it the allusion of being sweetened with currants when they are so ""absent"" that the sweetness is definitely the sugar.  I've found 1, possibly 2 currants per cracker.  Needed at least a tiny bit of sodium as is lacking in taste.  It's much more blackened..much...than the picture which I suppose hides the fact it has very few seeds.<br /><br />It tastes best microwaved for about 15 to 20 seconds then covered with a thin layer of cream cheese.  Doing this makes it a tasty treat.  But then covering anything in cream cheese makes it a tasty treat.  Not enough nutritional value and taste for me to purchase something so odd like this again, unfortunately."
positive,"What a find!  these crackers, I mean crispbreads, are great.  My boys love them as they have just enough fruit and nuts to add a more spalsh of flavor but not so much to overwhelm the taste buds.<br /> We have already gone through two boxes, and that was in a week.  I hope Amazon gets more of their flavors."
positive,"These crackers are quite unique.  Interesting that they are called ""Fruit and Seed Crunch,"" because the only fruit in the product is 14% currants, which adds a bit of a tang to the taste, nothing else.  As a Vegan treat, these are quite satisfying.  I smear some peanut butter on two; and that's breakfast.<br /><br />Imported from Great Britain, these crackers are made with whole grain rye and wheat flour and then lightly dusted with pumpkin and sunflower seeds.  Honestly, one of these things is quite filling.  The fiber content is good, too.<br /><br />As part of a healthy diet plan, these crackers are excellent.  Substitute these for bread and see how you like it!"
positive,"This is an excellent choice for a morning meal or an afternoon snack.  I was pleasantly surprised with the sweetness from the fruit in it.  The best benefit is the fiber!  Here is something that tastes great & you still get the nutrition.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E0QE1Y"">Ryvita Fruit and Seed Crunch Crispbreads, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>"
positive,"I love these! I actually don't care for any other flavors of crispbreads, but these make a really nice snack just on their own. I am not a health nut by any means, but these are a great alternative to reaching for typical sweets or snack foods when you need an afternoon snack."
positive,"I was at my friend's house in Syracuse. I bought these crackers in Wegmans. I loved them, but Hannaford at home doesn't have them so ordered from Amazon. Now all my friends love 'em too!"
positive,Just sweet enough to be a snack and satisfying enough that I don't need to eat half the box to feel satisfied. No guilt here.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy these again!
positive,Ryvita Fruit and Seed Crunch crispbreads are not too sweet but not so dry and dissicated that you want to smother it in peanut butter (although they taste great with PB!!!).  I eat these straight up as a snack at work or with a morning cup of coffee/tea.  Just the right amount of crunch and sweet.  Lots of fiber and lower in carbs than many others.  Can not beat these crunchy crackers.
negative,"I can't stand false advertising >:-(<br />The crackers are two mostly plain solid layers with stuff in between. I think there may be some seedy and fruity things inside, in between the layers...not really consistent fruit 'filling', but just randomly distributed small fruit/seed bits. Cracker tastes good when your bite happens to catch a fruit thing, but that happens like 3x per a cracker.  (Each cracker is the size of a regular index card.)<br /><br />Basically, CRACKERS ARE NOT SINGLE LAYER COVERED BY TONS OF SEEDS AND FRUIT BITS like you see in the picture!!!  Don't expect that!<br /><br />With that said, they weren't that bad.  NOT sweet (unfortunately), and taste kinda fibery.  Pretty regular dry healthy crackers.  They are not filling, unless you tend to be filled up by index-card sizes of crispy dry whole wheat bread.  But they may help curb your appetite for a short while?<br />I enjoyed them of cheese and honey on top :-) Yummy.<br /><br />Summary:<br />- cracker= 2plain layers with very little fruit/seed bits in between<br />- feels healthy<br />- tastes okay."
negative,"I thought the addition of fruits & nuts would soften the cracker & not be as tough as most of all the other Ryvita ""crispbreads"", but ney!<br /><br />They're crispbread for horses!"
negative,"Well... looks like hamster food, smells like hamster food, oh yeah and it TASTES like hamster food!  These crispbread crackers are nothing short of disgusting.  Health food does not mean that it needs to taste bad! I find nothing wrong with all-natural foods that actually taste good.  There are plenty of alternatives that offer whole grain and fiber and are much more flavorful.  The no sodium aspect is difficult to ignore but unless your tastebuds have suffered some sort of great catastophre than I warn you to look elsewhere for something more palatable..."
negative,"You can get one pack (2count) at Kroger for .97 and at walmart for .94  and if you are signed up for coupons you get $1 off 3 or 4 packages. These are price slightly high. If you like convince of not leaving your home, then go for it."
negative,"I was thinking of buying from here but then I thought of checking out the price in Walmart or Walgreens first.<br />Indeed, the price in Walgreens is half of the price here. As of this writing, the Amazon price is $10.69, while the Walgreens price is only $5.00 for a pack of 8."
negative,"please be care full with this as i just complained to gerber as i found black powder inside sweetpottato tubs that i got from BJs , just a word of caution as im yet to find out what it is from gerber .upon calling gerber they said it could be charcoal from overburnt product & they are saying "" as far as seal is intact its safe"" hellooo plz dont tell me charcoal or rust or whatever it might be found in a tub sealed can be safe? im now going to be carefull while giving it to my baby .. so please u also be just carefull to see if no black powder is in .. if so discard it ."
positive,"This is great for your little one, no artificial flavors or additives. But I found out after buying the stage 1, that stage 2 is cheaper & you get more."
positive,My daughter loves this. It helped her get hooked onto solids. The price with Subscribe and Save is at par with Walmart.. so I believe as cheap as it gets.
positive,"Tastes great. My babies think it is desert.  I like that it is only squash and water, nothing added."
negative,"It tastes fine to me, but my son will take 1-3 spoonfuls then spits it out.  Green beans and Spinach he can't keep down.  Hot or Cold he doesn't like this.<br /><br />I still try now and then hoping he'll change his mind.  He's 11 months now since we started him at 5 months and still doesn't like this.  He does like steamed green beans I cook, but not this.<br /><br />I've mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because I know its good for him.<br /><br />Good price and value, but not worth it if your child won't eat it."
positive,Perfect mix for me - lots of nuts and dried fruit.  I was buying it at Costco for under $9.00 but much as I really like it I hesitate to pay twice at much on line.
positive,"The flavoring is very good, not harsh at all and very easy to drink. However I can go down to my local grocery and get it at $1.50  a bottle, still making it much cheaper for a 12 pack there."
positive,the greatest tea ever. i actually am a distributor of this product the only one in so. cal but not being one sided. better than any prescription drug on the market. and better for you in the long term.
positive,"I have to get up at 4AM, and the longer the days get, the more difficult it is to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. Not with these wonderful tasting drinks! I am out cold within an hour. . . tops. I have tried Neuro, Zen Serenity, and now these, and these are the best by far (taste, effectiveness, etc.). I wake up feeling great; not like when you take a sleeping pill. Also, I ordered from Marely's (I assume this was a typo), and their customer service was SUPERB when I had a slight issue. As far as the price, a night's worth of sleep without taking a pharmaceutical drug, is worth every penny to me."
positive,"The only problem that I have with this item is that it does not in fact put you in a mellow mood. It knocks you out completely. Within an hour of drinking this, I have a really hard time staying awake. That's why I purchased it though, to relax and eventually help get me to sleep. I have also not noticed any side effects with my sleep, when drinking this multiple nights in a row and then stopping, like most sleep aids.<br /><br />It is also really tasty. It holds up extremely well against any other fruit beverage. This may be a con though as constantly wanting to drink a beverage that knocks you out can't be good for your social or work life."
positive,"I didn't know that this drink did more than just taste good the first time I drank it. I knocked out (fell asleep!) The taste is great, and we prefer the Black Tea over the green tea version. It is hard to find but we have found it at Sprouts Market and also some Shell Gas Stations. Check MMM's website for Store Locators. Walmart also sells it online but my local Sprouts store is cheaper than any online outlet so far. Good drink! Wish they also made the drink without the sleep effects."
negative,Ordered the product in the middle of june and i have yet to receive the product despite contacting customer service
positive,"This is by far the best TASTING sleep drink I've had. In fact, I find myself frequently wishing they made a ""non drowsy"" formula so I could sip it during the day, it's really that good! However, if you're a full blown insomniac (such as myself) looking for 8 hours of sleep in a bottle, this may not be for you. It's great if you need to catch a long nap, like 3-4 hours, but if you're looking for a full night's sleep I recommend Neurosleep! A little pricier, but that will take you out for a good 7-8 hours."
positive,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CT1NCY"">12 Pack of Marley's Mellow Mood - Black Tea Peach Raspberry Passion Fruit</a>I bought this on a whim, in a particularly bad walmart visit.  I was really surprised that after a few sips I was really not so bothered as i thought.  When I got home, I was reading the bottle, saw that it was quite natural ingredients, so since I never sleep for than 3-4 hrs. I bought a case at amazon.  Have used it off and on all month especially when I was upset and not sleeping, the calming affect helps me get back to sleep.  sandy in Central NY"
positive,"This really knocks you out and gives you great sleep without feeling any hangover. It's amazing. (It's also quite tasty, kinda like Snapple only if you drink too much you turn into Rip Van Winkle.) A family member recommended it and I'm glad I tried it. I wish it wasn't so expensive and more available though. Often, Amazon is out of stock and nowhere else on their website is listed as a seller.<br /><br />Update: I've noticed that since I started drinking this every once in a while when I have sleep issues, even if months have lapsed at a time, I've become more tolerant to the effects of the drink. (I found this, also, when I took Valerian pills directly. Valerian root is one of the ingredients.) So one bottle or two doesn't really put me to sleep anymore. This might just be me but I'd suggest not using it too often to avoid becoming tolerant. Just use it when you really need it...which I do but I tend to become tolerant to things very quickly. I wouldn't mind if the cost wasn't so exorbitant. Drinking two bottles a night can become pretty pricey if I'm having a week of insomnia. The thing is despite the price this does really beat the side effects of a lot of the sleep aids out there and trust me, I've tried A LOT of them. This is great for once in a while when your sleep schedule gets out of whack.<br /><br />Also, I discovered that Walmart sells the drink for $20! And it ships free if you purchase more than $45 so it's worth going over to Walmart to get 3 cases at a time."
positive,"This is a good way to start the day and this box will keep you going for almost two months.  Just add hot water and you're set.  It's quick and easy to prepare and very filling.  Plus, the variety pack will keep things interesting."
negative,"I purcahsed this oatmeal variety pack assuming I would receive the various flavors listed in the picture such as banana bread and cinnamon roll.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I get a box with just 4 flavors including 13 packets of original. Who in God's names wants original quater oatmeal via packet? If you are going to deliver pain like that, then ad and description should state so accordingly.<br /><br />Will not be making this mistake again."
positive,I needed some more oatmeal for breakfast and this hit the spot. I myself need more than just one packet and will typically use a plain and another flavor to use up the plain oatmeal. I don't know anyone that wants to eat plain oatmeal but that is my solution for the packs rather than throwing them away. Several people complain of the price but not having to deal with going to the store for it and the taxes of it more than makes up for any differences.
negative,"What is pictured and what you recieve is not the same!  The picture when I ordered had 6 or 7 different flavors pictured, one being banana, which is the main reason I ordered and I recieved only original flavors.  I will not recommend this seller and will never order from them again!"
negative,"I like the large variety of oatmeal but less that a week after purchasing this on Amazon (with Amazon Prime) for $18.59 on March 20th, I went to Costco and found the same exact product for $9.39. Save your money and buy it somewhere else."
negative,"The box I got is same as I can purchase from Costco but more than double the price, it's crazy.  I gave this a try cause I though this is different variety pack, No, it's just like you can get from Costco but more than double the price. save yourself some money.  This product needs detail information on what's inside."
negative,"When I ordered this product there were many more flavors listed such as ""cinnamon roll"" & ""banana bread""....so this is why I ordered.  When it came in the mail it only had 4 flavors.  Cinnamon & Spice, Apples/Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, & original.  I won't be purchasing this again on Amazon."
negative,False advertisement here. The variety I received is not what I ordered. If you are out of a particular variety don't send a replacement unless you have contacted the customer for approval. I don't think I would order a bulk variety again. I'll order the individual flavors instead.
positive,"The Quaker Instant Oatmeal Variety Pack, 52 Packets offers four different flavors of oatmeal to kick start your day. My box contained 18 packs of Maple & Brown Sugar, 15 packs of Apple Cinnamon, 14 packs of Cinnamon Spice and 5 packs of Original. Overall this is a good selection of a product that I enjoy on almost a daily basis. The flavored oatmeal might be a little sweet for some people, so be careful using this product if you have Diabetes.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
negative,"Good product, but this price is beyond stupid.  It wouldn't cost this much if you bought 6 boxes of the 10 pack at walmart."
positive,Tasty oatmeal start for the day. Cooked in the microwave while you get ready for work.
negative,"I bought these after recently being diagnosed as type 2 diabetic.  Probably not the right thing I have found out. They are handy for a quick breakfast.  The taste is not all that great although the texture is much improved over the older product.  Have offered them to other people, but they are not really enthused over the prospect of eating what one called 'wallpaper paste'.  I'm going back to coffee and toast."
positive,This is a very good product and the cheapest price for a pound that I've seen.  I will be getting from them every time I need some.
positive,I see this ingredient on product labels everywhere so I thought I'd check it out. I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what  -  it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling. Home made ice cream is another natural. Try it and discover your own uses.
positive,"A must for low carb foodies!  I've used it in baking, making low carb ice cream (which gives the ice cream a real ""mouth"" feel) and thickening sauces without the use of flour or corn starch.  Amazon has the best price on it, too."
positive,"I bought this because I was looking for a lower cost alternative to the $12 small bags of Red Mill Xantham gum I had been using to make gluten free bread. I was trying to lower the total cost per loaf, otherwise I might as well buy the loaves in the frozed section which are pretty good. I had already figured out a means to cheaply combine my own flour ingredients so I wouldn't need to purchase the expensive Red Mill gluten free flour. Next, I located on Amazon a great bulk deal on bakers yeast that also added to cost reduction (and was superior in result too.) After buying this Xanthan gum, I further reduced the price per loaf significantly. I have found this product works well and have not noticed any difference in quality of my results with my bread. So, I am very happy to have found this alternative at a more reasonable price. I also like the zip lock bag it comes in which is much more handy for baking and easy handling than the Red Mill bag."
positive,"This came well packaged and I found that this gives my yeast breads a longer shelf-life and far moister end product. If you love gooshy white bread, this is THE trick to making it super moist!"
positive,This is a great deal for Xanthan gum. I used some of this as a thickening agent during cooking with great results. The re-sealable bag keeps the product good for quite a while (possibly years if you refridgerate it) and I found no observable difference between this brand and other more expensive ones. A little xanthan gum goes a long way and this 1LB bag should last you quite a while.
positive,"I use Xanthan Gum for my home made lotions, creams and serums to name a few and it works perfectly! You need just a little and that will go a LONG WAY! This will last me forever!"
positive,"I used this in my Gluten Free baking and it works great!  For St. Patty's day I made my niece Gluten Free Irish Soda Bread using Gluten Free A P Flour, adding 2 teaspoons per cup of flour used and it came out tasting just like the regular bread.  Like I said, it works great, thank you for such a wonderful product, I will be doing a lot more Gluten Free baking."
positive,"We have to do a bunch of gluten free baking for my family.  This is the second time I have purchased this exact product.  I was disappointed to see that the cost went up 5$ since last year, but it's still about 7-8$ then purchasing at local retail shops.  This lasted us about 1 year using it for our baked goods."
positive,"A little goes a long way. Think baby steps when using, if you aren't using a recipe. I made fruit smoothies, with or without ice."
positive,"Ordering through Amazon is the easiest, safest way to order online. I received my order quickly and have never had a problem with an order being shipped incomplete. I order gluten-free products online because the deals are much better than anything found in the local grocery stores. Xanthan gum is costly enough, but you can buy it for less online. The product was fresh, sealed well and performed as expected."
positive,Makes my gluten free breads and desserts the absolute best! My bread seems to be nice and tender--not gummy and gluey. Thanks Essential Depot for a great product.
positive,"Since you are looking into purchasing xanthan gum I assume you know what it does. It acts like it should, and the resealable pouch is very nice."
positive,I have used this product all year without any problems (For gluten free baking).  Works great and best price I've found.
negative,"This product will cause SEVERE GI distress; even when used in very small amounts.  The gas pains and resulting diarrhea is not worth what it adds to the food product.  I bought it to make home made ice cream smoother.....  forget it!  I'd rather eat ice crystals than go through what my husband and I went through with just 1 tsp. in a quart of mix.  I looked it up on line and this is one of the MAIN side effects and says someone ""may"" tolerate after using for 30 days!  Why would one want to?  Even though the label says it is ""food grade"", the food service that used this product would soon be out of business."
positive,Love this and I use in a differnt way my husband can't swallow driniks well and this is a good thicken for that and so much cheater
positive,"I first bought this cereal at the HEB grocery store and it's priced between $4 and $5 for 1 box. It taste pretty good. Amazon currently sells it for about $3.95 a box, if you opt for subscribe & save. It's crunchy and takes longer to sog, which is what I like. I don't like Nature's Path Flax Plus Multibran Cereal or Heritage Flakes (not sure which one I tried). It gets soggy too quickly.<br /><br />And if you're curious about the expiration date, all 6 boxes (arrived 2 days ago) are dated for December 2012."
positive,"Great cereal, always seen in my cupboard. Amazon pricing most fair keeps me coming back."
negative,"This used to be my favorite cereal. It had fiber, good taste and texture but in the past year or two they started making it sweeter and sweeter. I don't like sweetened cereal. At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes? You can have it!!! Yuck!"
positive,"I've had ""ginger ale"" as a soft drink off and on throughout my life, both the regular and the diet varieties. It was okay. Then I spotted Reed's Extra Ginger Brew (all natural Jamaican Ginger Beer) in my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. What is this, I wondered? Well, looked it over and decided I just had to try it. Oh, my! It was good! Really good! It was so superior to the ""ginger ales"" I've had that there was just no comparison. And this drink tasted like real ginger and it  was good and strong! Boy, this is a fine soft drink. A bottle has just about the same calories as regular soda and I note 37 grams of sugar. I'm going to have to watch it. This stuff goes down so easy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
positive,This bubbly crisp ginger ale has an excellent strong ginger bite to it. There is no sugary taste to it like far too many ginger ales on the market. There is just a hint of honey to this lovely concoction. The crispness of all of Reed's Ginger Ales is incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day. Try it over ice cream for a ginger ale float!
positive,This ginger beer is really good. It is not as aromatic as some of the others which is one of the reasons I like it. I usually buy it for about a dollar a piece at the local grocery store. Can't beat that anywhere.
negative,"Reed's is probably the most well known brand of premium ginger beer on the market, but it is a mediocre beverage by itself and as a mixer. Even the Extra Ginger doesn't pack much of a ginger punch. I would give it 1 star, but it's better than Canada Dry and uses doesn't use HFCS. I prefer Natural Brew Outrageous Ginger Ale for drinking by itself or as a mixer and Gosling's as a mixer only, although Gosling's contains HFCS."
negative,"While certainly not as awful as Ginger People's ginger beer, I don't recommend it.  I love a good ginger beer, and this is all that my local grocery store carries and I still won't buy it.  To be fair, there are different styles of ginger beer and taste IS subjective.  But I can't help but feeling that something like Cock and Bull or Barritts is MUCH better and more ""authentic"".  (Although they are not nearly as natural.)"
negative,"Trader Joe's discontinued Bundaberg but kept this line. Go figure. Exotic label, bland taste. Bundaberg is one of the best I've ever tasted. Reed's: forgettable."
negative,"I have been searching for a good ginger beer, trying to find something that might compare to Bundaberg Ginger Beer, and was EXTREMELY disappointed with Reed's.  I was looking for that sweet gingery flavor, with a nice strong bite, and found Reed's to be nothing more than a bland drink with a lingering burn, NOT a bite, that resembled heartburn more than the gingery spice blast of a decent ginger beer.  Reed's was rubbery tasting, and tastes similar to a cheap non-alcoholic beer.  I literally couldn't finish my first bottle.  I pride myself on being able to eat and drink just about anything... so to be unable to finish this drink says a lot.  Oh Bundaberg, why aren't you sold in US grocery stores???"
negative,"While I agree that these nuts are quite tasty, the total weight of the eight packs is one pound. Thats $26.00 per pound for cashews! I can buy fresh-roasted spiced cashews at the local gourmet nut shop for half that and see them roasted right in front of me!"
positive,I tried these nuts at the Food Network's Food and Wine Festival and become a fan. The unique flavor of the Indonesian spices are unforgettable. A must try item for those cashew lovers!
positive,"I am so excited!  I haven't been able to find this double black soy sauce since (I worked in Boston) I shopped at the markets in Chinatown on the outskirts of downtown Boston.  The flavor of this soy sauce really makes my dishes, especially my pork lo mein, taste authentic (I guess I mean as it tasted in the restaurant).  Go easy though, the flavor is intense!  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying these wonderful imported treasures."
positive,The soy sauce I received is wonderful.  It is full-bodied and worked well when making Hot and Sour Soup.  Thank you.
positive,"For those who does not like the bones in sardines, Kippers are good alternative.  This one in tomato sauce suits my palate.  The one in grocery stores are all smoked brand, so if you like it plain, this is it!"
positive,"I have had cats for over 50 years, and this is the best litter I've ever used.  I currently have three cats (including one 20-lb guy who can urinate till the cows come home) and find this litter absolutely wonderful in controlling odor. I have switched litter brands over the years every time something ""better"" comes along.  Now I just pray that this one will never go away.  I've been using it for about a year and am thankful I was convinced by some of the online reviews to give it a try.  Best decision I ever made where cats are concerned."
positive,"This is the best cat litter ever. It destroys odors better than any other cat litter I have used.  When my<br />friends come over to my house, they always tell me that you can't tell that I even have cats.  There is no cat litter box odors lingering in the air.  One of my friends said that her sister has a cat and you could always get a strong scent of the cat litter box when you would walk into her house.  My friend asked me what cat litter I used so she could share with her sister.  I told her it was scoop away plus crystals and that it was the best stuff.  She shared the information with her sister.  Her sister started using scoop away and she was so pleased that she uses nothing but scoop away.  I know my cats love it and so do I.  It clumps well and it has a nice fresh clean scent.  You won't be sorry if you switch over from you present litter to scoop away.  It's the best."
negative,"I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best ""bang for the buck"" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!"
positive,"been eating seasons for years but the local supermarkets seem to only have 4 or 5 cans or none on the shelves...the delivery  here is prompt the supplier adequate...3 cans in a pan, butter old bay lemon juice and fry  'em up delicious breakfast...if only i didnt have to get spam mail from amazon asking me to buy things...this would be perfect"
positive,"These are nice to have for traveling with a peanut allergic child. I love Sunbutter. But the packets we got expire in only a few months, whereas the Sunbutter we got from Amazon don't expire for over a year, so I was a little disappointed because we probably can't finish them in time."
positive,"We ordered the Sunbutter Sunflower Seed Spread On the Go Pouches because we were traveling with a 5 year old grandson who has allergies to peanuts.  He regularly eats Sunbutter and loves it.  The convenience of these travel pouches was terrific.  The amount in each pouch easily provided one sandwich, the size made packing easy and convenient.  They helped to make our 15 day European trip worry-free.  I highly recommend them."
positive,Perfectly packaged. I take these to the gym to have as an after-workout pick me up. Protein and fat and just a little sugar. Marvelous.
positive,Great for road trips and dealing with peanut allergies.  It's a great idea that I've been looking for when traveling for quite some time now.  Really great!
positive,"Because of finding this in GoPicnic meals from Amazon, we searched this item excited to have a case.  It's good but didn't expect it to expire in just a few months.  We have 3 cases now...  I know you can get better expiration dates than that so was disappointed and took off a star.  Otherwise it's a great alternative to peanut butter and from what we've heard so far...better for you."
positive,"I was looking for a product that is not made in China, contains mostly meat and does without a long list of unhealthy ingredients. Having older rescued dogs with very few teeth, the treats also needed to be soft enough for them to chew. Pet Greens Treats fulfilled all of these requirements. The dogs aren't crazy about them, but will eat them. With all the dubious treats coming from China, this is a good choice."
positive,It took my dogs a minute the very first time I gave them these. But after they sniffed it for the first time and ate it. They were hooked. Now if my dog even sees the bag he starts drooling. They just love them! I just wish they were a little more affordable...
negative,"Product was advertised as Porcini Powder.  The product that we received was labelled 'Dried Mushroom Powder.' It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company.  More importantly, tasted/smelled like ""watered down"" porcini, not 100% porcini.  Looks like a 'bait and switch' to me and we will definitely not order again."
positive,"This porcini powder tastes wonderful. It adds a deep richness and depth to tomato sauces and especially any type of Italian recipe. It's concentrated so don't use a ton at once. Has that distinctive mushroom smell when you open the top, but adds sooo much flavor to my cooking. Great in soups, too!"
positive,"Very happy with this powder. I sue it when I want to add richness to soups, stocks, stews, whatever. A little bit adds a subtle amount of umami and richness (not necessarily identifiable by most as mushroom flavor), and if you use more the mushroom flavor is more pronounced. It doesn't take much to really enhance whatever you put it in."
positive,What a great product to have for adding that extra mushroomy taste to many recipes.  Great in soups and sauces.  Also great in burgers and meatloafs.
positive,"This sauce has a great Mexican taste beyond its peppery fire, and the bold color, even though created by dyes, is just plain fun to look at. The splash of red on fresh veggies, lettuce, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, its bright flavor goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people, who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use."
positive,"I have tried many recipes for gluten free bread. Most of these recipes claim to be the ""best I have ever tasted,"" or ""Can't tell from regular bread."" Nonsense! Soggy, dry, crumbly, tasteless, or weird tasting is more like it. One recipe from Australia turned purple!. So, I didn't have high expectations for my latest recipe made with white bean flour. Surprise! The gluten free bread made with the white bean flour is my most successful bread so far. No one would mistake it for regular bread, but it is light, toasts well, and doesn't crumble. I will be ordering more white bean flour."
positive,"We love this food for our dog, his coat has a lot of improvement and his allergies are way better now that he switched to this food, we used to use large breed Science Diet and Nutro and they dont even compare to this food.  We even feed this to our little terrier dog as well as our Mastiff with the problems.  Definately recommend this food!"
positive,"My Lab's 12 yrs old, and her coat had become dry, dull and she was shedding handfuls every day. This is all I feed her now as daily kibble, and she's silky, shiny, hardly sheds at all. She's also slimmer, perkier, more playful. Combined with Voltage (sold here on Amazon, good price too) to deal with stiffening failing hips, it's like she's years younger. [ASIN:B000K7J8GU Bio-Kinetics Voltage for Companion Animals, 1 Jar]] If her fur didn't have so much white hair, no one would believe she's over 7 or 8.<br /><br />Once my delivery arrived w/the bag torn. Amazon replaced it, free. I love the service on Amazon!["
positive,"Great dog food shipped to my door monthly. My boxer enjoyed the food from day one. Great amount of meat, fruit and veggies!"
positive,"My 125 pound Rescue Cane Corso has been thriving on C&P for the three yearws that I've had him.  The vet -- on his ""rgular"" visits (no emergencies to date) -- often compiments me on his beautiful silky coat. . . . .The price is reasonable too -- although I wish it cost less. . . . .I LOVE the delivery service.  Purchased, of course, through Amazon."
positive,"We have a big black dumb Great Dane named Otis. Otis is six years old.  We switched him from Eagle Pack Large Breed to Castor & Pollux due to the availability of Eagle Pack in our geographic location and price.  After eight months on this feed, I have no negative feedback on the product.  Otis's elephant-sized poos are firm and he loves the stuff (I suspect he'd eat just about anything though). His hair coat is shinny and energy level is sufficient.<br />*Otis approved review*<br />JB"
positive,My dogs love this food. My older shepard would have runny poop alot but since we switched to this food about a year ago it stays solid and she is happier.
positive,"This dog food's ingredient list definitely makes you feel better feeding it to your dog, but I do notice ours are really gassy after eating it.  Not sure why that is.  They have been eating it for months, so it isn't just the transition to new food.  Maybe all the veggies?  I also notice that they do not digest the carrot pieces at all.  But a natural food is way better than what they used to eat, so we are sticking with it for now."
positive,Chicken meal can be those cute little chicks that would have grown to be roosters. (Excess at the hatchery so the little buggers get ground up -often alive- for animal food). It is not those guys then it is poultry processing byproducts and not something I want for my pup. It smelled delicious - very wholesome. Didn't smell like dog food usually smells when you buy something from local petshop. Also price went up when I ordered it via a subscription.
positive,"Although I do love Castor and Pollux Organix marketed items for my dog. If you prefer your dog be on organic, this food is not. It's ""natural"". Natural Ultramix. Considering the level of ingredients, it's not near it. The Organix one equal to this has more Red on it. But it's up to the individual, their pets needs, and the level of income to what they can afford :)"
positive,Excellent service for this very hard to find product.<br /><br />Thank you so much.
negative,What is it really?  I'm not going to purchase it unless there is clarification.  Plastic bottle?  Black Walnut extract is too precious to waste in a plastic container.
negative,"The picture on your ad is not a black walnut.  It is an english walnut.Though I have not tried your black walnut flavoring, showing an english walnut might be confusing for the consumer."
negative,"It doesn't taste like walnuts, plain and simple. It tastes like paper glue loaded with alcohol. And I got heartburns afterwards. Who knows what is in this. I really regret buying this, what a waste of money."
negative,I had to put in a rating or it would not have taken my review...I have never used this product so it may be a good flavoring...I just wanted to clarify the picture.  It is not a picture of a black walnut....it is a picture of an English walnut...there is a big difference.......I was looking for a fine black walnut flavoring....
negative,"This product is packaged in plastic bottles.  I buy all of my spices, extracts, etc. in glass containers only. I would not have ordered this had I known it was shipped in plastic bottles. Because the price was low, we discarded the un-opened plastic bottles rather than try to return them."
positive,"Like the same vendor's Wasabi peas, these peas are use Yellow 5 and Blue 1 dyes to color them. That is a needless addition which no one needs. They also fry these with what they term 'vegetable oil' which according to their package adds about 1.5g of fat per 1 oz serving. Their Wasabi peas are said to use Palm Oil and add 3.1g of fat (almost 1g of saturated fat) per 1oz serving, so I wonder what 'vegetable oil' really means for these peas. Other products from this vendor have nutrition information that is completely wrong (like 0% for everything), so I wonder what really goes into these peas. They are salty and crunchy, but it would be nice if they did not have a bunch of dyes in them and there were clarity about what oil and how much really is in them. Fresh wokked English Peas will be a whole lot better for you, if not a convenient snack at the office..."
negative,The peas are way too salty to eat I talked to the owner she did't care about the condition of the peas.
positive,"These taste like a fruit roll up with bits of crunchy seeds in them. Overall really good, though a bit too sweet for me (I don't like fruit roll ups for the same reason). I gave one to a coworker and she loved them so much she went right online and ordered some. I didn't notice it curbing my hunger at all, but it'd be a good snack if you were craving something sweet."
negative,"The shipping on these fruit chia bars was very fast but it wasn't free. The mailman left me a little envelope saying I owed him<br />85 cents! Also, I thought these were sugar free but the lable says there's 23 grams of sugar! Also, the flavor wasn't that great. I won't be buying these fruit chia bars again."
positive,These are great mushrooms and you can't find them in the stores.  A bit pricey though which is the reason for the four stars instead of five.
negative,"Dear Gatorade:<br /><br />Biggest fan of the G2 powder pack!  I have bought hundreds of these boxes in the last 18 months!  Tastes great, less filling!  Boxes stack neatly in the pantry!  No more boxes???  G2 in my store now comes in a slippery plastic cylindrical tube (for more money).  Doesn't stack in the pantry.  Yeah, it's still Gatorade G2 powder, but it's a pain in the posterior.  Packages teeter-totter on the shelf and fall all over the place.  Why do companies like yours screw up a good thing?  Did you feel you needed to make your product look all spacey-agey and better than the other box powders?  Have you tried to put this on your own pantry shelf?  I gave this 2 stars only because it used to be a perfect product.  I've reluctantly moved on to Propel."
positive,These are dry biscuits that my dog likes a lot. I expected them to be soft; but they are dry like dry dog food. They are easy to crunch for my dog. My dog is about a hundred pounds and these biscuits work good as training treats which are easy to handle and use. My dog likes them; so I'm glad that I bought them. I had used the soft varsions of Natural Balance training treats (chicken and beef ) about a year ago with good results; I had to cut those up into smaller sizes where as these biscuits are at a good size now for immediate use.
negative,"product was broken [???] could not be delivered,other item on order never arrived.called customer service and also told them<br />that my credit card # had been hacked and I knew it was from this company.no interest at all or concern at what I was telling them.<br />Would never order again from amazon."
positive,I love the taste of the Republic of Tea teas and I love the fact that they are surgar free! A win win for me!
positive,"These are very good tasting and when I gave a few to my baby he loved them! But after looking at the back and seeing that the second ingredient is sugar I decided this probably isn't the kind of thing I want my baby to get used to. I don't want him to get used to sugary snack foods at such a young age, I'm sure there will be enough of that when he's older. I wish Happy Baby would come up with a yogurt snack with no or very little sugar, I would buy it than."
positive,"Son loves these, these actually taught him how to chew. We thought he didn't like them at first, but after a few tries he was not afraid of them anymore (these were his first non-pureed food) and now he crawls to the pak and begs for them and wants lots at a time. These are organic and so much better for kids than Gerber Graduates yogurt melts which contain food coloring and other additives.. We will be re-ordering these very soon!"
negative,"I picked these up at the health food store- as the Dr. Sears reccommendation caught my eye. My eight month old son immensely enjoyed them, and I looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second, right after the cultured milk. It is organic sugar yes, but still added sugar- and I'm bummed as this was not something that I wanted to introduce to his diet yet. My fault that I was swayed by advertising, and didn't read the back."
positive,"I've been feeding these to my 10 month old as ""dessert"" for the past month or so, and he loves them.  I like them too, and have been known to pop one in my mouth when I'm putting them on his tray.  We were out the other day, and our local grocery store doesn't carry happy bellies, so I picked up a bag of Gerber melts.  How different could they really be?  As it turns out, very.  Baby ate the Gerber ones okay...but I tried one and almost spit it out.  It tasted like cardboard. These ones actually taste like strawberry yogurt.  You can't go wrong!"
positive,My son started eating these at 12 months. He's now 18 months and still loves them!! They're healthy and I feel good about giving them to him. I would say this is his favorite snack - always cheers him up!
positive,Shared this flavor with my moms group kiddos and they were a big hit. I have put in a request that our local Publix start to carry this flavor because they don't carry it and no one had seen it yet.
positive,"We used to get the gerber ones, but for almost the same price these are a bit smaller for him to handle and he seems to like them much better."
positive,"Would you believe that my daughter doesn't like yogurt?! Odd b/c I thought every child loved yogurt... these are the answer for my yogurt-avoiding-14-month-old! She thinks these are candy and pops them in her mouth one after the other. I have to admit that sometimes I enjoy a few myself! Price is good at a couple of bucks per bag. I mix these with her cheerios and it makes a delicious snack. I too tried the Gerber brand b/c they were on sale at our local supermarket but they were not such a hit. Strange b/c to me, they taste about the same... go figure!"
positive,The Banana Mango flavor is not our daughters favorite so will not order again but I love the melts in general and we all enjoy them so rec. to any baby/toddler.  Great alternative to the other popular sugary brand.
positive,"These are such a  wonderful alternative to the non-organic, sugar filled ones you find in your basic stores.  The melts are very tasty (I have tried them) but are not all the same size so for new solid food eaters you may need to watch which sizes they are given.  Have not tried the other flavors yet but plan to get them.  Wish they would sell a varity pack instead of having to buy 8 of one flavor."
positive,My baby loves these treats (as does the rest of the family).  The fact that they are organic and are sweetened with natural cane juice rather than added sugar like the name brand grocery store type makes them even better.  Even though you have to buy 8 at a time we just found someone to share the order with.<br />Have also tried the mixed berry flavor with equal favor.<br />Highly recommend!!
positive,"I purchased this organic yogurt snack for my daughter.she said the snack melt in her mouth quickly ,the different flavor tastes different, she likes the mixed berry most.<br />The only concern is the sugar content is still a bit high ,so I try to limit the amount I give her when  on the go ,at the playground ,recommend other moms  to try."
positive,"My daughter is 16months old, I bought it for her, she like it very much! But I don't wanna give her much one day and let her know to share with her parents and friends!"
positive,These yogurt snacks are staple in my one-year old's diet. She eats them every day and for snacks out on the town. No complaints at all.
positive,"I purchased this snack fo my baby, but after i tasted I thought it's good for all family members!!!  so yumm~~ first it is kinda crunch and melts right away inside of your mouth~~ .you can fully taste yogurt flavor!!<br />However, do not forget to seal it tight ! specially rainy day!!! it is very easy to get soggy!"
positive,"We have been buying these melts for about 7-8 months now for our daughter. They do tend to go fast, and since they are pricey we buy them sparingly and give them to her as a special treat. No funky ingredients in these that you cannot pronounce. I love how you know exactly what you are giving your child with these (and bonus, NO artificial colors/dyes!). I definitely recommend them as an addition to your diaper bag essentials. They keep my daughter busy when she is getting antsy while out running errands. Overall a great snack to have on hand for your little one(s)!"
positive,"My 14-month-old loves these yogurt snacks. I've been pleased with all of the Happy Baby line including cereal and puffs. Also, I just recently bought a few of the frozen items, which have gone over well. Delicious and healthy!"
positive,"He doesn't like many dairy products, but these he loves.  And, they have no gelatin for the vegetarians out there.  They make his fingers sticky, but so do all the yogurt melts."
positive,My son is obsessed with these melts.  He will literally drop whatever he's doing at any given time if I present these to him.  I tried them and I don't like them but every child I've met loves them.
positive,"I would definitely recommend these. They taste a lot better than Gerber yogurt melts, and they are better for you. Even my husband likes them and will snack on them, which is saying something because usually anytime I have him taste our daughter's snacks, he makes a horrible face and asks how in the world she can eat it. Not the case with these. And my daughter (now 17 months) likes them, too!"
positive,"Happy Baby products are the best!  The yogurt melts are not messy at all and it's great to give your toddler a snack that's organic and has real fruit inside!<br />Happy Baby's customer service is great- everytime I contact them with a question, they respond within a day with so much info!!"
positive,"My 2 young toddlers loved the Gerber yogurt melts, but it was getting too expensive to buy so many packs every week. I ended up trying these Happymelts, and thank goodness my daughters liked these too.  Personally when I tried them, I preferred the Gerber better as these were a little chalky, but since these are organic and cheaper on Amazon, I went this route. Love that this is yogurt that doesn't make a mess, doesn't require refrigeration, and is easy to transport. The girls love this when we're out and needing a snack."
positive,My baby eats these like they are going out of style. They are the perfect size for her to grasp with her fingers.  So nutritional too!
positive,My son and I share these as an afternoon treat every day.  They're his absolute favorite (and mine too!)
positive,"We introduced this finger food to our little guy when he was eight months old. He could not get enough. Super easy for this kiddos to handle and the melts ""melt"" in their mouth so no worrying on the parents' part necessary! Easy to travel with the pouches also."
positive,My 11 month old daughter really loves these.  They are easy for her to eat and they melt in the mouth faster than cereal.  This is a great finger food to start kids on because it melts so quickly and is easy for a baby to eat if they don't have a lot of teeth.
positive,"I just want to say that my daughter likes to eat very much ,I had to control her<br /><br />Sour and sweet,and organic."
negative,"Let me start by saying my two little boys (1 and 2) like these, but I think it's because they don't know any better! These have a foul smell and taste. I don't know what is creating that odor and taste since these are not expired. I will not order these again. I don't know how some of the adult reviewers who are eating these can stand them. We buy happy baby greens puffs and love them. I have bought other happy baby items and thought they were great. These are a miss."
positive,These are great and my baby loves them but I have to pick through the bag to give him right size.  Some are small and some just too big for my little guy.  I wish the company could come up with some kind of quality control.  The Gerber yogurt melts are very consistent but I prefer these because they have more vitamins than Gerber.
negative,"We purchased this product and the ziplock seals did not function, so there was no way to reseal the package after opening.  We tried to contact every single email address on their website and nobody at that company thought it was important enough to respond.  There are lots of organic baby products out there, and we will purchase from other companies and hope others will do the same."
negative,These should have an age limit. I do not think that breast fed babies under one should be allowed to eat these. Babies do not need probiotics at such a young age. My daughter ate about 5 of these and a couple of hours later projectile vomited all over the place! She does not spit up ever. I wished that I would have bought just one bag of these before I bought a whole lot of them!<br /><br />I think she will like them when she is a little older and used to eating other foods. She is mostly breast fed and eats some solids.
negative,"when i recieve this item, the jub was split down the middle and ketchup was all over inside the package it came it."
negative,I specifically ordered the 114 oz. jug because I have a pump that fits it. Instead I received 3 44 oz. containers. These will be returned.
negative,Oh my Gosh...How can anyone pay this astonishing price for the same container of Ketchup available from multiple local stores for less than $6?
positive,"This is good oregano. It is just little to much - 3 bottles, I had to give one to my sister."
negative,"I BOUGHT THESE FROM AMAZON PRIME FOR 10 ON OCT. 26.  NOW THEY ARE 26 PLUS 8 FOR 34 INC SHIPPING.  AMAZON PRIME NO LONGER CARRIES THEM OR OFFERS THEM ON BACKORDER, IF THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK.  I will look at other brands, but non as price attractive as those offered by amazon prime a month and a half ago.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAOD4K"">La Moderna Maria Roll Cookies, 6-Ounce (Pack of 20)</a>"
positive,"This a best product, we all love SHAN's Masala Mix(especially Biryani Mix). But here it looks so costly, we buy this for $0.99 each from local Indian Store...."
positive,"This is the best tomato soup I have tasted, ever. It's sweet and tomato-y and very well seasoned. I always hated tomato soup growing up, since I was fed that popular brand with the red label. Then one day I tried this, and was blown away. Low in calories, too!"
negative,"I love the McDougall food products, but this one didn't quite measure up. It has an aftertaste that I didn't enjoy. If you can find a single container to try first, I'd recommend doing that."
positive,"This soup is okay, but not as good as some of the roasted red pepper tomato soups I have had in the past.  Don't be deceived by the box size.  It is not one of the bigger boxes you buy at the store.  They are about the height of a regular can of veggies."
positive,Exactly as described. It tasted great and was awesome getting so many of them. I felt like I was entering my own personal grocery story every time I opened my cupboards. :P
positive,My dog is very picky. I tried these treats because he doesn't care for rawhide or 'chewy' types. These are baked and smell wonderful. Very crunchy and you can break them in two if you want. They come in a zip- lock bag to keep them fresh. They are a bit pricey (I wish they'd come in larger numbers) but well worth it for my dog.
negative,"My dog loves the sweet potato chicken wraps which is why I was so disappointed when I read i tiny letters on the back ""made in China"". Although this company as not been recalled to the best of my knowledge I'm not willing to risk giving my dog any treat made in China."
positive,OUR DOG LOVES THESE TREATS... SHE WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET THEM... HER TAIL GOES CRAZY KNOWING SHE'S GETTING A DUMBBELL
positive,"Thanks a lot, Treat-Umms. Before we discovered your product, we used to sleep in, say, to 7:30 AM or so. Since we have been giving our 6 dogs (5 chihuahuas and a Japanese Chin) Chicken & Sweet Potato Wraps as a morning treat, they have trained us to get up at 5:30 every morning, or earlier, to get their little mouths wrapped around one of these wraps. They are relentless. And of course, being fairly intelligent and trainable, we have complied with their wishes completely. (BTW, one of our chi's has a liver condition, and these treats agree with him just fine.) This product is highly recommended (unless, of course, you value your sleep).<br /><br />Signed, Sleepless in A-town"
negative,"What more can I say? I usually buy this kind of treat at our local discount shopping center, but I realized those dumbells were made in China, and that made me nervous after all the quality control problems China has had with pet foods and treats. If I remember correctly, I think these are made in the US, so I felt better about giving these to my dog. Too bad she wouldn't eat them. Picky, picky!"
positive,My poms love these! Hard to find in stores - glad to find them online for about the same price.
positive,received on time... items priced less than normal purchase place.  my doggie loves treat-umms.
positive,Our Bichon loves these drumsticks.  They're natural and you can break them in two if you'd like.  These are his favorite treats!
positive,He will eat these if he has to but prefers plain old chicken wrapped rawhide.
positive,"This product is made with excellent quality ingredients and packaging.  The vanilla that is added gave my biscotti, sweet rolls and cakes the best taste ever. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who bakes. It's delicious."
positive,"This is very high quality cocoa powder, with high cocoa butter content.  It makes excellent hot chocolate, brownies, mochas, and frosting.<br /><br />It is not Dutch process, so it is suitable for most uses which do not explicitly call for Duch process cocoa.<br /><br />It ships in a durable and resealable plastic bag, and stays fresh and dry for months."
negative,"Okay,<br /><br />I bought a case (4) Jars of this ""Kauffman Pennsylvania"" brand Pumpkin Butter.<br /><br />At first I thought I got a batch of rotten butter due to the 100 degree heat. Bitter Blan taste.<br /><br />Turns out that my 32 year daughter likes this product because It's low in Sugar compaired to the other brands.<br /><br />I find It very Bland, Almost like the canned Pumpkin that you buy to use to make Pumpkin Pies. I had to add Cinnimon to my Peanut Butter & Pumpkin Butter sandwich.<br /><br />No Cinnimon and clove flavor at all. (Bland) !!<br /><br />I myself love Trader Joe's brand. It Bursts in my mouth with Flavor !!<br /><br />I love Trader Joe's Pumpkin butter so much, I just bought a case of 24 Jars at $2.50 a jar. Normal price, Not Bulk price.<br /><br />I see others here on Amazon.com selling the Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter for $14.50 a jar !!<br /><br />I'm no way affiliated with or nor am I an employee with Trader Joe's<br /><br />I just love Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter, Love it !!"
positive,Really enjoyed orange slices in the past.  Have not had in a long time and this purchase did not disappoint.  Fantastic price of $7.57 w/free shipping. Slices very fresh..  Simply stated - extremely pleased.
positive,"This syrup is quite delicious with the combined toffee and nut flavors. The flavor does remind me a bit of popcorn though for some reason. If you are looking for a syrup to make the Starbucks Salted Caramel Mocha then this toffee nut is not the same as the one Starbucks uses, it has a distinctly different flavor. It is very good but not quite what I was looking for (hence the 4 stars).<br /><br />My product came in a glass bottle with a metal screw-on lid, but shipped surprisingly well in the mail.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 oz. Calories 80; Sugar 21; Carbohydrate 21."
negative,"My kids love this cereal, but I won't be buying it again. Or any other Kashi product.<br />Why? Kashi led us to believe that their ingredients were healthy. Then it was found out they were using GMO's. This was the exact thing that I thought I was avoiding by buying Kashi."
positive,"I'm sharing my ultimate chicken recipe secret here...Preheat oven, 350. Crush Kashi Warm Cinnamon Oat Cereal between two sheets of wax paper. Then, after dipping skinless, boneless, chicken breasts in Almond Milk, I roll each chicken piece in the Kashi crumbs, then dust pieces with paprika (or cayenne if you like the heat) and garlic powder. (I do this in two steps because I omit paprika and garlic powder on a couple of pieces for my Grandson) The combination is to die for. Spritz with EVOO, oven bake as you usually do for oven fried chicken. While the chicken bakes, put 4 T. coconut oil on a cookie sheet and place on empty, lower rack in oven. Slice 5 washed yams in 1/4 inch diagonal slices. Remove the warm cookie sheet and toss yams in melted coconut oil. Return yams to oven. Yams will be done about the same time as chicken...but check so they don't become mushy. You will love this chicken, if you love cinnamon, and the yams are better than candy. Hope it makes your day."
positive,I recently bought this cereal and it tastes great. The cinammon flavor the cereal gives is satisfying and when you're all done eating the cereal itself you're left with cinammon milk.
positive,Nice to have these cinnamon oat cereal.  My kids love them and they are a healthy breakfast.  I give them at their lunch for an extra  treat.  Love the taste.
negative,"I really like Kashi products, but the cinnamon taste of this is overwhelming, unlike the subtle enhancement that Cinnamon Harvest was to Autumn Wheat.  I regret buying this because it is way too strong, even for this person who really likes cinnamon."
positive,"You can get it cheaper at stores, around $3.00 each.<br />I'm not sure why would I buy 4 boxes at a time and pay more than $3.00 each."
positive,"My husband is a type 1 diabetic, and this is a breakfast cereal he can eat without blood sugar issues and enjoy the taste of. Cinnamon gives it a great flavor without needing a lot of sugar. Yummy!"
positive,"Healthy,excellant taste. I'm sure kids would love it also;my 9 year old grandson does. So much better for you than other cereals;more protein and fiber. Great deal next to the grocery store."
negative,"YIKES!!!!!!!!! What a hound dog!!!! This tastes like a cinnamon candle or holiday air freshner. I LOVE the original but this one is a dud!!!<br /> Sorry, Kashi, I love everything else I have tried!"
positive,"This is my favorite tea. Very strong Bergamot aroma, and the tea is very fresh (I just drank a cup this morning from a bag I bought in January and it's not stale yet!). The silk bags allow really fast and thorough steeping. Shipping was super quick, and I love that the sachets are all in a single, resealable bag, rather than individually packaged. Less packaging=less to throw away. These are 2-cup sachets, but I use them in regular mugs, just being sure to only steep it for a few minutes. Sometimes I get a second cup out of a sachet if I save it (I'm not a purist, I just like tea!), but if you have a 2-cup teapot these are perfect for that, too.<br /><br />I bought the 50-pack in January and I need to buy another one real soon.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just bought another pack, plus one of the Chocolate Mint, and it's just as high quality as the last. Definitely recommend this tea and seller."
positive,"This stuff I found at my sister's place. I tried it and loved it. It made me think of raisin branne [sic] with yogurt. Why don't those guys make that? Or berry bran? Or banana bran? Diversify Brainiacs!<br /><br />Be very very careful. Don't ignore the verbiage on the front that says it has lots of fiber. I am a dude. I don't know or care what the hell that gibberish is supposed to mean.<br /><br />But I learned if you do 2-3 bowls of this awesome tasting stuff, it better be your day off of work. Or else you WILL be racing home from work for the duration of the whole day.<br /><br />It shoots the plumbing with a quickness. Recall or google Pope of Greenwich Village. When Paulie slips the cop a Mickie.<br /><br />I love the flavor and the healthy parts, but I only do 1, that is ONE bowl each day or couple days MAX.<br /><br />Be Smart."
positive,"Got this on sale at my local grocery store to try it out. Wow! Love this cereal. Perfect amount of crunchiness, sweetness, and fiberness. I really like the flavor and sweetness of the yogurt pieces. Aside from the possibility of extra gas, this is an incredible cereal."
positive,This is a great cereal. It was fresh and crunchy. Just like what you get in the store and a good price as well. No complaints at all.
negative,"I am always looking for new cereal products.  I usually stay away from Kelloggs as my first thought of their products is sugary cereals that mess up glucose levels.  I am very disappointed Kellogg's FiberPlus® Berry Yogurt Crunch cereal.  First it tastes similar to Sugar Frosted Flakes....way too sweet. Second, I eat a lot of 'rival' high fiber cereals and they do what they are supposed to do. Not this one.  And the product labelling is do I dare say a lie.  Misleading the public. 10g of fiber is 40% of 25.  10g of Fiber is not 40% of 28 or 35.  USDA recommends 28g per day.  Kelloggs has decided to change how many calories are recommended each day for an adult.  They changed it from 2500 to 2000.  Why. What do you think. I can think of at least three reasons.  I do not purchase Kellogg cereal and after this, never will again."
positive,"This is a good, healthy alternative to the regular sugar laced cereals.  Sure it has sugar as well, but the health benefits more than make up for it.  I would definitely buy it again!!"
positive,"A flavorful, low-acid coffee, our standard brew.  Consistently gets high marks from dinner guests, a good endorsement in a coffee town like Seattle.  Amazon price is consistently lower than local supermarkets."
negative,"Coffee did not smell fresh like coffee upon opening package.  Also everyone at home and the office that drank it had to make a few trips to the bathroom (#2), it seriously upset my stomach.  Did the beans get picked to early?  Tried ordering again with the same issues."
negative,"UPDATE: After receiving order . . .<br /><br />My first review was a shimmering adoration of Argo tea, and this tea in particular. Now that my order has arrived and I'm drinking a cup, I have to ask: what happened? I used to be addicted to this stuff when I lived in Chicago and could go into an Argo store and buy it off the shelf. I remember it . . . differently.<br /><br />So--either I have changed, which is possible, or the other reviewer is right. (And my apologies for assuming he or she was misjudging.) There is something off about this tea, and I don't know what. But it does taste artificial and out of balance. Maybe it needs Chicago Municipal water to make the right chemical combination essential for the flavor I miss. But wow; what a disappointment. Proves the adage, ""you can never go back."""
negative,"Nasty, chemical aftertaste.  Smells artificial.  I'm disappointed I wasted my money and will not be ordering from this company again."
positive,"These tomatoes were packaged well and sent quicker than usual.  According to the people eating them, they were solid and juicy and full of flavor.  I will continue to order these as long as they are available for the season."
positive,"My kitty went nuts when i first opened these. She kept running around my legs looking for the source. she can't have enough of em! Thankfully they're organic so she could have as much as she wants, and i don't have to worry about diabetes or diarrhea."
positive,"Relative to other products of this type, this brand, usually, is cheap - I bought this for ~$8. The flakes I received came in a resealable bag and not the container pictured. I have tried feeding these flakes to 3 different cats and under no circumstances will they eat them. When I initially gave a flake to one cat - Who eats all kinds of treats - she ate it. Five minutes later, she vomited twice. She did not eat it too quickly and chewed thoroughly - I watched her. If your cats love them, they are a healthy treat and not too expensive (4-5 stars). If your cats hate them, they are a stinky waste of money. Make sure, even if eaten, these flakes are not causing vomiting."
positive,"I'm rating this 5 stars even though I haven't tried this specific product yet. Two out of my 3 kitties go nuts for tuna flakes! This was an ""emergency"" purchase as I ran out of what I usually buy, which is from Asian Food Grocer dot com, sold as people food, 3.5 oz. for under $6."
positive,"Well these Bellyrubs Treats, although a great product, were not a hit with my cats.  Only one of my babies liked them.  She was happy though because she got ALL of them."
positive,"I prefer to eat alone as it is very important to me to savor each nuance with unobstructed emotions and not be tainted by someone else's opinion (besides the unruly one named ""Dog"" just horks stuff down.  I'm surprised he hasn't eaten the bowl by accident).  By dining on my own, I can laugh or to weep as the mood dictates, mindless of the sort of inhibitions companions might pose.<br />The first time I experienced Bellyrubs snacks, I tentatively licked up a flake and then another, and then another.  Each piece was a joy!  My shoulders relaxed.... my mind expanded.  For a moment nothing existed but me and the delicate tuna flakes.<br />Eating these treats do not disappoint, they are pure unadulterated, uncompromised joy.<br /><br />More please!<br />Steve-The-Cat<br />,,,^. .^,,,~"
negative,"I guess my cat is not into fish but rather chicken and beef, when I opened the bag and put some on the floor, he just sniffed it and looked up at me as if to say ""what is this?"" and walked away no doubt disapointed, now I have no choice but to throw the whole bag away because he won't eat it, next time I'll just stick to Temptations treats, he loves those."
positive,"We use these for training our kitty. Whether it's toilet training or trying to get him to ""speak,"" these work great.<br /><br />Only minor caveat is that they crumble easily, but I think it's just the nature of tuna flakes in general.<br /><br />1 box lasts a while and we feel better about treating him to something healthier than some of the other stuff out there!"
positive,Cant get it out of the container fast enough! All 3 cats go crazy for this stuff & they never agree on anything! I'm ordering more!
negative,"First off, I thought I was buying a container with a screw on lid,<br />such as the one in the photograph on this listing. What I received instead<br />was a blue mylar-fused zip-top bag. Those are harder to seal and keep fresh,<br />in my experience.<br /><br />Then the item itself. Sure, I read the reviews. At some point, food and treats are<br />food and treats, and you hope your cat will eat them. Well, count two cats here who<br />could not care less!  I shook some out on the floor. Both looked at me like I had<br />littered, and missed the trash can! There was cautious sniffing and walking away.<br />I ended up having to vacuum it up off the floor later.<br /><br />Now, I know it is a myth that cats adore fish. It's a cute story, and the fish bones<br />are just so darned cute when the graphic artists draw things about cats. The truth is that<br />most cats prefer some sort of poultry, and eat birds and mice - not fish. Few cats live<br />in the water, and even fewer own fishing rods! ;  )  They do not regularly attempt to eat<br />fish. (They do, however, love trying to catch the small ones in aquariums, just like they<br />would like to catch any moving object.)  My bad for not remembering that fish is at the bottom<br />of a cat's food choice list.<br /><br />What a waste this purchase was!<br />I can't recommend it at all. It was smelly, the cats ignored it,<br />and I definitely did not appreciate getting a different item than was pictured.<br />I wanted the one I thought I was buying based on the picture, not a substituted ziploc bag.<br />Seller should notify buyers of the difference and offer to cancel the order."
negative,"The seller needs to update the picture. Product comes in a bag and NOT the screw-top container. Very misleading. Will not order again. The cats love bonita flakes, and trying to find a place for the bag that they can't get to will be a difficult thing. A hard container they can't chew on is what I thought I was getting. At minimum, the seller should be updating the description section to advise buyers."
negative,"Quite disappointed in the product - not like other crostini crackers I have had in the past.  They were almost (not quite) burnt, but very close. I will not order this brand again. And now I am stuck with 11 packages.  Oh well another of life's lessons learned."
positive,"I've tried at least a half dozen different types of these costini crackers, all bought through Amazon, and these were my favorite. Also got a graet price by sucribing for a once a month delivery.. They go great with wine."
positive,"These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!"
positive,"Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!"
positive,"I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.<br /><br />They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!"
positive,I love these.  I bring them to work for a between meal snack.  They are bold and really take the edge off my hunger.
positive,"When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you."
positive,"Not a big fan of chili actually... so these almonds are perfect!  ok sounds weird right!!??  What i am saying is that i LOVE LIME, and these almonds are mostly lime with a very subtle hint of chili n spice as an after thought... PERFECTION!"
positive,"I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend."
positive,These are sooo great tasting and the individual  packaging is  great to get them handy around. Perfect buy to stock up as the individual packets are rare to find and there are many favors available however this one is my favorite.
positive,"I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!"
positive,"Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!"
positive,"If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.  A better buy than the Habanero BBQ ones for sure.  I would buy them again and they are great with a cold beer."
positive,These things are great. Perfect size bag for an afternoon snack. If you like salt and vinegar flavor you will like these.
positive,"I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time."
positive,"I don't know what they put in these things, but whatever it is it's addictive. The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of ""I'm going to eat this entire can RFN.""<br /><br />The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more."
positive,"I gave half of the 6 pack to my friend visiting from Tokyo. We both love them. Although, it would be nice if they came in bigger cans."
positive,The product arrived on time and fresh and this was the only place that I have found this tasty snack.  I would buy them again.
positive,I absolutely love these nuts! I can't find them where I live so I will continue to order these from Amazon. They are well worth the price.
positive,"Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want."
positive,"I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.5oz package daily with lunch, but buying them in bulk makes so much more sense.  Yum!  The empty cans are good for storing loose hardware and small things around the house."
positive,"Found these by accident - they are so tasty. Very hard to find in local grocery stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  Will probably be ordering more.<br /><br />4/2/11 - I have since bought 3 more cases. I took some to work and everyone wanted to know where I got them. They asked me to sell them some when I get another shipment."
positive,"I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the ""bold"" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!"
positive,My husband absolutely loves these.  He's self-employed and spends alot of time on the road - takes apples and these nuts with him.  He's even given them away at the jobsites and the guys all love them.  Great product and the free shipping is a real plus!
positive,"I recently discovered the Salt & Vinegar Almonds they are delicious. The individual size is perfect for when on the go. I also purchased the cans for at home. Almonds are a very heart healthy snack, just try to limit yourself to a few a day. For my taste I would like to have more vinegar flavor."
positive,I ordered some of these and literally ate them each day through all 24 packs.  They are addicting and delicious.
positive,"I love these nuts and it seems that most stores carry all flavors but the Jalapeno, I won't hesitate to order these again if I cannot find them next time, gotta have 'em!!!"
positive,"These are great! As a lover of all chips I'm so happy to find a healthy alternative.<br />It's a great, flavorful snack."
positive,Enjoyable all times of the day. Just the right amount of salt and flavor. This is becoming a favorite in my house. I also take it to work to satisfy that afternoon craving.
positive,These are not easy to find in stores...and one must be diligent to keep them on hand! They do not create sores from acidity...they are better than any salt and vinegar chip I ever tasted. Highly recommend. Even better...new individual packets you can throw in your purse have been seen!
positive,"This flavor is the best of the bunch by far.  I am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack.  I tried these and I was hooked.  Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks."
positive,"To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again."
positive,"My fav bold BD almond by far. Completely addicting. TY Lord that they are pretty expensive. Not the best nut though. That distinction, of course, goes to Mauna Loa garlic and onion fav Mac."
negative,"These have no bite at all...Nothing. They should scratch off the ""Wasabi"" from the label... on the verge of false advertisibg...""Bold""...My behind...the only reason for 2 stars is that they are at least Almonds...."
negative,"I didn't like these.<br />I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.<br /><br />Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol."
negative,I used to love the smokehouse almonds but the last few cans I bought SUCKED! Bland with little flavor.  Does anyone know if they changed ingredients or recipes or something?
positive,"The cans are teeny tiny, and for what they charge it's just not worth the expense. Also, I really hate how they charge different prices for different flavors. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. The product itself is yummy, just not happy about the prices."
negative,"I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that."
negative,"Tastes like a poor Ranch fav almond. Barely any lime. What are these 5 star reviewers eatting anyway. Proably the wasaibi and soy bold BD almonds. Save your money and calories, do not buy these. Buy extra wasaibi."
negative,"I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce, buy this product.  The nuts are of a high quality."
positive,"This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a ""BOLD, and This Time We Mean It"" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods."
positive,"Wasabi!  Almonds!  What's not to love?  Can't stop eating these, glad they come in packs of six..."
positive,"These are great, and I love the bulk purchase with Amazon. Worst danger is that you want to eat more than you should because they are really very good."
positive,These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.  You can't find this flavor in most stores and the typical Blue Diamond can is much more expensive else where.
positive,"I am so thankful that Amazon has these wonderful almonds! Our WalMarts used to carry them and made a big mistake discontinuing them. There are six people in my office alone that LOVE these Jalapeno almonds and we have looked everywhere for them! I hope we will always be able to find them here!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Blue Diamond Almonds, Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse, 6-Ounce Can (Pack of 6)</a>"
positive,"These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly."
positive,"The title says it all.<br /><br />The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out."
positive,"Wow! These are amazingly tasty! Addictive, even. I only wish they were easier to find!"
positive,"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
positive,"Great BBQ flavor with enough Habanero to give it a nice little kick.  The flavors are not overwhelming, so the taste of the almond still shines through.  A really nice snack that's just a little different."
positive,"These Salt and Vinegar Almonds are one of the best snack foods I have ever tasted!  They're just tangy enough to give you a good kick.  Hard to find in my local stores, so I came to Amazon and bought a case  :-)"
positive,"I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi."
positive,"I love these so much. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds, you will love these too. They're hard to find in the store but Amazon has you covered."
positive,These are my favorite flavored almonds!  Intense flavor!  I can't get enough lime.  Hard to find in the stores though sometimes.
positive,"This wonderful combination of flavors proves to me that heaven truly exists. If you are a fan of Salt & Vinegar chips, you will LOVE these almonds! I've been through 2 cases of it and counting... shhhhhhhh!"
positive,These are the best nuts ever and the value is best with the 6 pack.
positive,"I don't need to say much more, these are good. Not really hot like you might assume given that it's jalapeno flavor. They just have a slight kick."
positive,"I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel ""mouth-satisfied"" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value."
positive,"This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my ""diet food.""  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!"
positive,"Almonds are super nutritional food and while high in fat, are certainly better than cheese puffs!"
positive,"These are very good.<br />Like salt-and-vinegar potato chips, but more substantial and delicious. The almond gives a nice hint of sweetness under the assault of the vinegar. I've eaten 2/3rds a can at one sitting."
positive,"I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought ""When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds"" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too."
positive,I am so delighted to get these Salt and vinegar Almonds.  None of the stores near me carry them.  They are actually great for my diet.  I can eat as many as I like yet the amount has less calories than if I was eating chips.  I can only eat so many nuts at a time while I can pig out on chips and waste lots of calories. My friends are always digging in my closet to see if I have any when they visit.  Love them.<br /><br />mls
positive,My whole family loves these almonds. We're buying a pack of 12 about once a month. Great price (even cheaper than what we've been able to find at the grocery store). Great quality. Healthier than salt & vinegar chips :) Wish Amazon had this item as a Subscribe and Save!!
positive,I absolutely love the new bold Salt & Vinegar almonds by Blue Diamond! It just doesn't get any better than this!
positive,"A great flavor and 4g net carbs, 2g sugars. Nearly guilt-free snacking and an awesome amount of fat. These aren't the ideal nut for low-carb and/or keto diets, macadamias are probably closer, but these are much more widely available and the flavors make it easier to snack reasonably."
positive,"I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!"
positive,"My dog was recently diagnosed with kidney disease and the vet recommended the k/d diet.  I bought a 5lb bag at the vet's office for $32.00 of Hill's Prescription K/D dry dog food.  The vet told me that there were different brands and I'd have to experiment to find out which one my dog would like.  Not knowing that I would need a prescription for such dog food I went home without a prescription.<br /><br />My dog seemed to like the food - so knowing that a 5lb bag wouldn't last long I went in search of this special dog food. I went from store to store trying to find the k/d diet dog food.  I quickly found out I would need a prescription - of which the vet had to mail to me.  Even with the prescription you can only buy this special dog food from a vet's office.  Well for me - that's totally inconvenient.  My vet's office is a 1/2 hour drive away and with my work schedule and kids - it's not always convenient to drive for an hour just to get dog food.<br /><br />At one store I found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet food which could be bought without a prescription.  The clerk there was exetremely knowledgable and helpful.  She told me that the Hi-Tor Neo Dog food was actually better than the Hill's Prescription k/d.  I thought I  would try it since the 10lb bag was $24.99.  My dog loved it!  The clerk told me that they might not carry this brand for much longer so I went on the internet and found that Amazon carries this product. Even with shipping I'll be saving more than half of what I would spend at the vet's for a 10lb bag - not to mention the cost of gas and my time for a round trip.  I compared the labels and I do believe that Hi-Tor is actually better than the prescription brand.  In short, it's better for my dog, my dog likes it, I don't need a prescription and it's half the price with more convenience than the other dog food - what's not to love about it?"
positive,"My wife liked these as much if not more than Haystacks from Russel Stovers Chocolates.  If you like Haystacks / Coconut clusters, these will do.<br /><br />Chris"
negative,"So this company markets Samurai Rice Crackers and Oriental Rice Crackers.  I was under the mistaken impression the Samurai version would be spicy.  They're not.  I got 8 packages.  And none have been spicy.  There may be a subtle hint of heat.  But very subtle.<br /><br />I love rice crackers for whatever reason.  But I could've bought plain rice crackers locally for less.  This product is selling for close to 4 bucks a pound + shipping.  The bins at Whole Foods, Publix and Fresh Market have it for close to the same price + no shipping.  I also have purchased a better-tasting variety at Big Lots, 1 buck for about 12 oz.<br /><br />What I will say is that it appears these crackers are made for long-term storage.  They're in a thick bag that I can't open with just my bare hands.  They're really sealed up.  If you want to still have rice crackers during a hurricane or if that big earthquake hits, this is a great buy."
positive,"Yeah, they are alright.  Just your usual standard rice crackers.  No peas, peanuts, wasabi, or sesame sticks.  The quality is fine, but I was hoping for a little more variety.  Costco seems to have stopped carrying their oriental mix here and I was looking for a replacement.  Not with this product though."
positive,I love all of the Beefeaters products but this is the very best according to my dogs! My four labs love really these treats!  I believe this product is healthier than most dog treats and give them to my dogs often. They enjoy all of the different sizes and it's nice to have options (e.g. quick treat or slow treat).  I highly recommend these treats!
negative,My dogs love the flavor of these things and they can spend hours chewing on them.  The problem is they are SO MESSY.  They are covered in chicken that flakes off all over the place.  I like the concept of chicken covered rawhide but I need to find ones that don't require a vacuum!!
negative,"Seriously, what could POSSIBLY be in these thing to make them worth so much?!?<br /><br />I thought Target was on crack asking $14.99!!<br /><br />Last time I checked Rawhide was the skin of a cow? Is this beacuse they can't make leather jackets out of it?"
negative,"I purchased these nuts as a gift and was disappointed when they arrived in a small brown paper bag, not a nice tin or box as I expected. I would not order again."
positive,"I bought two bags of the Altura whole bean coffee off an Amazon special. The price was great, the surprise is how wonderful the coffee is! Deep, dark, oily, fragrant beans, high moisture content, rich flavor and aroma. I had to cut down my normal scoop levels this coffee is so rich."
positive,"If you like a big-flavored, dark roast...Altura organic is hard to beat.<br />I do a French Press every morning...I like it even more than Pete's. Took it to my brother, a discriminating cappuccino drinker...he has now switched to Altura's San Fran Blend.Even if the bag is marked Swiss process decaf on the side of the bag, it is definitely full-test!Confirmed by a call to Altura and the strong jolt I receive from one cup!<br /><br />My only question is how does Amazon sell it for only $14.77 for 2 LBs and no shipping (On Subscription)..I just hope it lasts, because I am a huge fan."
positive,This coffee is the household staple.  Love the all around flavor and darkness.  Great with or without sugar and easy on the palette.  Auto ship is the best!
positive,I like a deep roasted aromatic coffee that can stand up to a huge slosh of half and half. This one can. I'll buy again.
positive,We really enjoyed the coffee!  We used to drink Starbucks House Blend.  This  coffee is just better!
negative,"This is the second, and last, time I will buy coffee from amazon.com.  The first time, I received a bag of coffee that had been out of date for months.  This time, it's still stale, but without a use-by date on the bag.  So much for trying to save some money and time.  I'll go back to making the trek to Whole Foods."
negative,"I don't know if I got a bad bag, but the beans that I received smelled extremely funky.  Almost fishy.  The coffee that they made was decent, certainly better than I would have expected given the smell of the un-ground beans.  Nevertheless, I threw most of the package away, as I couldn't stand the smell of the beans, even when only semi-conscious in the morning (before drinking coffee, of course)."
positive,"My boyfriend and I LOVE this tea. Though it doesn't necessarily feel as though it ""cleanses"" you, it certainly makes you feel clean. Typically cleansing teas taste awful but the Bija tea has a wonderful taste. It is my favorite tea by far."
positive,"Dynasty Potsticker Sauce is a winner!  It's as tasty as any I've had in Chinese restaurants--the perfect blend of soy sauce and spices.  It complements the potsticker w/o overpowering its taste.  I love it, and am very hopeful that Amazon will again stock it--and SOON!"
negative,"I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired."
negative,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now.  I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.  Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water. My mother in law sealed the container and took these pictures I have contacted the company but I have yet to hear from anyone."
negative,"Again, I had a problem with the product leaking ---  Both my original and replacement order. The manufacturer's packaging simply does not protect the contents enough. The box soaked through and this time, one of the top faces just tore right off because it was so damp.<br /><br />When I buy other liquids from Amazon such as the ""Zola Acai drink""<br />([...]), the plastic containers are better equipped to sustain the shipping process unlike these coconut water cartons.<br /><br />I really enjoy Vita Coco's coconut water products. The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating. However, I will give credit where credit is due and Amazon has been prompt to respond to my concerns."
negative,"I ordered two boxes of 6 VitaCoco water.  I only received one box, so clearly I was miffed that I was missing half my order.  Making matters worse, after opening the box that contained the six Vitacocos, the packing cardboard was clearly wet, and indeed a box had burst and leaked Vitacoco water all over the insides.<br /><br />According to the Amazon returns policy, the items could not be returned, but customer service was willing to refund the purchase.  So kudos to Customer Service, but jeers for everything else."
negative,"Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same."
positive,"Vita Coco's packing was a fitted box with extra cardboard and probably not enough on it's own. Amazon's added heavy duty bubble wrap that had very little give (different to what I usually see for other items) and box was packed well and I got my Vita Coco in quick time and in perfect condition. No leaks, no dents, all 6 boxes tasted good! Will now consider the monthly subscription. I was hesitant based on the poor reviews I saw about packing...but I think Amazon seems to have fixed that. Also I got from the other reviews that there was a bad batch that got shipped out which affected a lot of people. It also seemed that most people got replacements which I would be fine with. Will buy again."
negative,Vita Coco.  The most repulsive tasting coconut water on the market.  I won't be buying them again. I have had the plain flavor.
positive,"I purchase both Zico and Vita, like both of it, but I think Vita is best in taste, zica kinda water down on taste.  From now on Vita will be my choice of coco water."
positive,"First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water. I have tried this variety (Vita Coco) and the Zico brand, which were comparable in price and quality. Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion. So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold. As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories. One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more). The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add."
negative,"If I wanted to drink water that tastes like white bread: I'd drink Vita coco.  I grew up in the Caribbean, and coconut water doesn't taste like this."
negative,"I have been drinking coconut water for a couple of years and I got my father drinking it by going on the Subscribe & Save program and shipping this to him. I finally cancelled it because at least 2 of the containers would be leaking, the box would be soaked, and it's not such a great price if you're only getting 4 boxes out of it. It's crazy and I have received no response from Amazon or Vita Coco regarding my complaints. I am a loyal Amazon customer and that will not change, but I will never order Vita Coco to be shipped again."
negative,"I usually never write a review but I feel compelled to do it this time. THe packaging is very poor. The coconut water color are dark, almost black. It is crazy that they are selling spoilt food products and get away with it."
negative,"Coconut water was somewhat sour tasting, probably due to the fact that the expiration date was very close. I will cancel the subscription and continue to buy this product in a supermarket."
negative,"I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of 33.8 ounce Vita Coco coconut water.  The package arrived fine.  I put 3 boxes in my refrigerator.  Boy, did they make a mess!  All 3 started leaking overnight.  My wife was not happy at all. I transferred the leaking packs to soda bottles.  I don't want to try putting the remaining 3 packs in the refrigerator and will transfer to soda bottles as well.  I wish I could get a refund, but there is no way to return now, and no easy way to contact the vendor.  This turned out to be a real pain!"
positive,"Hands down the best coconut water I've ever had.  I've already ordered about 5 cases of these things and will order more when I run out.  The only downside I've experienced with it is the packaging.  My 2nd and 3rd order came in and apparently some of the cartons were punctured, which give off a terrible smell in the package.  I contacted amazon about the problem and they immediately refund my order.  I received my most recent order today and was pleasantly surprised to see all of the bubble wrap around the product.  Each carton was perfectly protected and I'm very happy with my purchase.  I guess they've received enough complaints about the shoddy packaging to finally fix it.  This price is unbeatable btw."
positive,"Ive been drinking coconut water my whole life and seriously LOVE the stuff.  When I first found VitaCoco all i could think was these guys are geniuses and somehow managed to create a coconut drink that actually tastes like the real coconut.  When I saw amazon was selling the product in boxes of 6 i thought, ""Even better, its shipped right to my door."" That is until i received my second shipment and found a box full of sticky Vita Coco packages with two of the boxes open and half empty.  I decided it would be apt o return the boxes, but for whatever reason, that is not in the Amazon return policy.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Love the product, but the shipment packaging sucks and Amazon wont allow you to receive credit or return the broken boxes."
positive,"Something is definitely wrong with vita coco's boxes. Two of them leaked enough to soak the cardboard boxes they came in. I checked and it appears to be something wrong with their peal back seals rather than the boxes themselves and I will be calling the company so they can address their faulty packaging since it's not Amazon. The drink itself is better than a few that I've tried thus far. I mix them with protein powder after the gym or sip them on their own. Very tasty. Better than Zico which tasted strange to me.<br /><br />If you order it and get a pack that leaks, call the company and complain. They need to know from anyone who has a leaking product that their product is faulty. It's not amazon as the foil seal on the boxes wasn't secure. In fact, I'll be raising issues of product tampering as a safety issue.<br /><br />The drink itself is great. The packaging not so much."
positive,I love the drink the only probem is when the box gets beat up duning shippiing I have several of the boxes leak.
positive,"it came with a pack leaking, wet the whole box. the product is good, but to pay this much money and only able to enjoy 5 pack that you actually paid for 6 is not a good deal."
positive,Delicious and transaction was quick and professional.Drinking this product definitely made you feel good about what you were taking into your body and was truly yummy.
positive,"I signed up for the subscription hoping the bad reviews were just flukes on the shipping.  The taste is great as always, but one of my boxes was damaged in shipping and leaked all over my laundry room.  I should have contacted the retailer to get it replaced but I just mopped up the mess and made a mental note to cancel my subscription and order a smaller size.  I do wish they would address the shipping/packing problem as it has been mentioned more than once on this site.  Whomever is making the executive decisions for their packing and shipping needs to come up with a better plan or more customers will go elsewhere!"
positive,"If you like coconut water, this is for you! I had bought this product at a local market to try, while having chemo. Turns out the more i drank, the more i wanted! It has potassium in it, and some chemo makes you potassium deficient. So, i felt better drinking this product,along with lots of water, to say hydrated."
positive,"It's summertime, with lots of days over 100 degrees F. in Central California. Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water comes to the rescue! It's the most refreshing drink I have ever had, and the added Vitamin C takes care of that nutritional requirement at the same time. Also, Vita Coco tastes much better than other coconut waters I have tried."
positive,"I've tried many brands and this is one of my favorites. The cheapest I've seen this in stores is at WaWa (NE gas station, rep!) and it's $2.50 for a 17fl oz box."
negative,"Taste was good but CocoLibre is superior.  I am giving the product only 2 stars because of 6 cartons, one of them was unusable because it was leaking from the bottom and we don't know if it was contaminated."
negative,This is the only time I will order this.  I like coconut and I like water but this stuff is nasty.  Maybe I got a bad batch or something but I won't make that mistake twice.
positive,"First of all I LOVE VitaCoco Coconut water!! So ordering it was a no brainer for me. I had read several reviews that some people had issues with leaking containers when they received their shipment. It appears that Amazon or VitaCoco has taken steps to remedy this problem. I ordered the 6 - 33.8oz containers. They came packaged snug in a box that fit them perfectly. And that box was then wrapped in bubble wrap and put inside another box! No leaking! I am sooo happy with my order. I hope this review will help others with the decision on ordering this product. Based on some of the reviews that I had read, I almost didn't order from online. Hope this helps =)"
positive,"I use it in my organic juices as a base sometimes lots of k and sweet, but low in cals, if you have not tried coco water, please do"
positive,"I don't know about the energizing levels but this tastes great and provides great health benefits! You really feel the difference when you come in from the heat during summer and have this! very thirst quenching compared to water which isn't enough usually. wish they would give more deals, discounts and promo codes! I do love this so but the price prevents me from buying it more often."
positive,I found this product to be a great alternative to sport drinks. It is loaded with potassium but does not have the salt and sugar found in traditional sport drinks. The flavor is a little bland by itself so I add a little unsweetened fruit juice and it really fits the bill. Highly recommended!
positive,"I am a brazilian living in the US and drank VitaCoco in Brazil for many, many years. Out of all the coconut waters I have tried, VitaCoco is the one that is the freshest of all, it can't be beat.<br />I saw a few other reviews that the customer had problems with the shipping (leaking boxes), but I haven't had any problems so far, with 2 shipments of these liter packages. I have a third on the way, I am hoping for a hat trick."
positive,"Very tasty stuff!!! I heard all about how this is the greatest drink ever, although 99% of what I heard I believe is hype I'm sure some of the claims have their root in fact.  It really did help me get over some pretty nasty hangovers."
positive,"Amazon does not always carry this 34-ounce container of Vita Coca Coconut Water (comes in package of 6). Wait, however, and it pops up on occasion.<br /><br />I think this is the best, sweetest tasting coconut water around. Even the Vita Coco in the smaller containers do not match the taste of the 34-ounce package. I have no idea why this would be the case, but after months of comparing it is simply, to my taste buds, true.<br /><br />The Amazon price is comparable to the prices I find at our local grocery store. Note that if Amazon does not have it in stock, private sellers do, and they always charge a lot more (plus shipping!)."
positive,"Growing up in South-Asia, I drank coconut water almost everyday from real coconuts. This product comes just as close to the real thing as possible. Great taste, quenches your thirst, I always take one with me when playing sports, way better than some sports drink, at least in my opinion."
positive,"When they say it is like putting a straw in a<br />coconut they are telling the truth..Clean, clear,<br />crisp taste..<br /><br />I travel from Michigan to the Caribbean with<br />one sip...<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy....."
positive,"I used to live in Hawaii and really missed fresh coconut water.  The water from supermarket coconuts are hit and miss.  I have tried Zico, ONE and Vita Coco, and although they are all good, I find Vita to be the best tasting.  The only complaint I have is that it is a little pricey, but it is worth it for something so tasty and healthy.<br /><br />Just one more note, you sometimes see coconut water in cans.  That stuff usually has fillers and added sugar.  Always read the labels before buying because there is a lot of junk out there."
positive,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.
negative,My local Food Emporium at UWS carries this product for $4.19 per 34oz pack so this is way too expensive at Amazon for $5.50 per pack.
positive,"vita coco tastes almost like plucking coconuts from tree and drinking fresh. if you have never experienced coconut water before, certainly drink it very chilled.<br />i found this 34oz resealable package to be ideal for my family (my husband and daughters are addicted to vita coco). 34 oz feeds them for 2 days (if that) and is less waste than having to throw out several of the smaller 11 oz sizes.<br />next purchase will be the 17oz size."
positive,It has a bit of sour taste to it. Definitely not the best I ever had. I prefer O.N.E. much more.
negative,this product tasted rancid it seem like a lower in product was able to camouflage with Hawaiian Punch and lots of ice. I do not believe I'll ever ordered again was very disappointed. Expected better quality for the price found it Fred Meyers cheaper and fresher.
negative,"I've had many other coconut waters, all of which had added flavor.  But this one I can't choke down....I like the others I've had, I really don't like this one!"
negative,I LOVE coconut water.  I drink it every day.  This is the worst kind.  It just doesn't taste right at all.  Amy and Brians or ONE are much better.  Even the cheap Tasco brand is better than this.  Do not buy this... please Amazon start carrying Amy and Brians or try to keep ONE in stock.  They keep putting this on sale because its NOT GOOD!
positive,This pesto was a lot more bitter than others that I have had and made. I didn't expect that but it was still enjoyable. I do not recommend it with whole grain pasta.
positive,"This pesto is certainly edible. I like it, but it does not make the meal an eating experience like some other pestos. We bought it to save some money, but we went back to the more expensive brand afterward."
negative,"I tried this product on my dogs 3 times and each time, they would not touch it!  Admittedly, my dogs are picky, but no even one of them would try it.  They would walk up and sniff it, but they would not even taste it.  My dogs (3) are all small dogs and don't eat a lot of food.  Maybe if your dog is larger or less picky, it would appeal, but I can't say I would recommend this product."
positive,My dog is small and loves loves treats. But treats she can toss in the air and run around with. She couldn't get the idea this was just a taste. She really thought at some point I would give up and give her the bottle. I am passing it on to a friend who is trying to train her dog not to pull on the leash. I realize this is a training tool but my dog didn't seem to think so. She did like the taste.
positive,"I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there."
positive,"Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their ""licks"" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous ""Four Paws Up"" from my test panel!  Highly recommended!"
positive,"I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!"
positive,"Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert."
positive,"Nina, Sam(antha) and Grizzly are ""licking it up.""  The feature that appeals to me most is that the calorie count is so low per ""taste.""  It's a real snack alternative that many of us with pets should consider!<br /><br />Great idea!<br /><br />I rate ""PetSafe Lickety Stik 1.6-Fluid Ounce, Bacon Flavor""...Five stars!<br /><br />P.S., As many pet snacks are notoriously high in fat, I truly recommend this as a low-calorie alternative!<br /><br />P.P.S., Maybe they should come up with on for us humans?  Just a thought!"
positive,"I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog."
positive,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>Joy-Joy likes these strange little treats.  They remind me of roll-on deodorant.  They have a very strong smell."
positive,"My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily."
negative,"The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'."
positive,"I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)"
positive,"Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and ""best"" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  ""Reilly"" recommends the treat!"
positive,"I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt."
negative,"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that."
positive,"My two Min Pins, who are constantly begging for treats, and then turning their noses up as most of what is offered to them, absolutely love this product.  They actually sat in front of me and took turns licking from the container.  It was hysterical; like two hamsters drinking water.  I will but this product again!"
negative,"Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package."
negative,My dog just didn't like the taste of them which surprised me since he likes food.  Tried each flavor same result.  I cannot recommend.
negative,"I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently."
positive,"My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!"
negative,"This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways."
negative,"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that."
negative,"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary."
negative,"I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
negative,"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long."
negative,"I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy."
positive,"I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that."
positive,"I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket."
positive,"Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house."
negative,"Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like ""Tussy"" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus."
positive,"Very handy way of dispensing a reward. Very palatable and dog is eager to get the next lick. Keep's one's hands clean while dispensing the treat. It seems great for training, as it is quick and easy to access and use. Great new product!<br /><br />*Donn (the dog) loves it. :)"
negative,I tried with my dogs but they didn't like it at all. I ended up throwing it out .  Very messy.
negative,"This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it ""Dog Bone Icing"" it might sell better  and make more sense."
negative,"As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of ""savory chicken"" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it ""Icky Stik"" or ""Stinky Stik"" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of ""Braised Liver"" or ""Smoky Bacon""? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star."
negative,"This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think ""Lickety Stik"" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions (""give a lick"" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless."
negative,"Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog ""treats""??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole ""Likety Stik"" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the ""Likety"" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the ""Stik"" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say ""ewwww get this thing outta my face right now""!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit."
negative,"I decided to try this ""treat"" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
negative,"Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it."
negative,"**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors; Savory Bacon, Braised Liver, and Savory Chicken**<br /><br />Above is the description given for the Lick Sticks and the reason that I made that choice. What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me."
negative,"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."
negative,"This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail."
positive,"I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.  I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it."
positive,"I thought this looked interesting a liquid dog treat what? So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down."
negative,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
negative,"I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs."
negative,"I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon."
positive,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:22 Mins<br /><br /></span>I selected this item thinking I would try it out on my parents dogs, but when my husband saw it on the counter, he wanted to try it with Kitty. Ha! She hates everything; there is no way she is going to like this stuff. I was wrong. To my total and utter shock, my cat actually liked it. So, here's the video to prove it."
negative,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again."
positive,"I was resorting to the old trainer's trick of smearing peanut butter on the fridge or a plastic stool, so my new rescue dog could happily lick it off while I brushed him. It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more."
negative,"This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing."
negative,I was recommended this for my 15 pound rescue dog and her ongoing training.I initially loved the product...till she clamped down on the neck of the bottle sending the small down (roller) down her throat...I was very very lucky as I administered Peroxide immediately and she brought back up after 5 minutes...but please be aware that this can be dangerous
positive,"I guess the idea here is that you can reward your dog with quick and tasty lick of a thin liquid on a roller ball. Seems like a decent idea, especially if you're trying to train your dog.<br /><br />The problem, in our case anyway, is that our dog is sort of lukewarm on this treat. He'll lick it sometimes, but other times, he just isn't interested. I asked him why, but he declined to comment."
positive,"I tried several times to get my jack russell terrier to use this treat, but he prefers chewing on something rather than licking his treats.  The only treat he has patience with licking is a little cup of  doggie ice cream.  Even ice cubes he will crunch instead of lick.  I was also a little bit bothered by the smell of the product; there was an oily odor to it.  This treat may work for little dogs or dogs who have more patience but sadly not my dog.  It is a good effor though."
negative,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in dark flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
positive,"This is great stuff!  I have a dog w/ no teeth and he could not have treats w/ the others.  Problem solved!  He LOVES this.  It's a bit messy but I've learned how to ""administer"" the treat w/ minimal dripping.  My others beg for it but I save this for my 19 y.o. toothless guy.  What a pleasure to be able to reward him too after potty call!"
positive,"Yes, this must be very good, all of the dogs loved it, and didn't want to stop licking it.  They lined up waiting their turn.  Would recommend as a treat."
negative,"My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count."
positive,"I got the savory chicken flavor for our dog, and he totally loves it. He'll perform any trick just to get some licks. It's easy to use and there's no mess. Great idea for a product! I plan to buy more!"
positive,"I tried this product on a new dog I had in training, because I liked the idea of a liquid for increased reward value.  It has turned out to be a great reward for many dogs I work with as well as a great reward in numerous situations.  In many performance sports you need to be very careful when rewarding your dog on a practice field that there are no crumbs left behind.  This product is PERFECT!!  I also don't need to worry about my pockets getting eaten out of my pants after training.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the price you pay here!!!!  I buy mine locally at less than 1/2 the price you see advertised here.  Even Petsafe will sell it to you for $8.99 not $13!!!<br /><br />Otherwise certainly a 5 star product!!!!!"
positive,"We have two little dogs and they have shared the licks.  I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.  I really do think the dogs will get militant when the bottle runs out, though.  For all I know, it's just sugar water, but whatever it is, they really like it."
positive,"I love the idea of the Lickety Stik:  a dog treat without all the extra calories.  Unfortunately, the design of this product makes it difficult to use.  The roller ball is very firmly fitted into the top so that it doesn't really roll.  It's mostly stuck in one position unless I manipulate it with my fingers (which are then covered in a strongly-smelling liquid that is difficult to wash off).  My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this ""treat"", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution."
positive,"I have my Min-Pin boarded at the home of a friend who has what looks like a Westie. I took the bottle of ""Lickety Stik"" over when I went to pick up my dog. Offered it to both dogs. The westie loved it, however my Min-Pin would have nothing to do with it. Maybe that's because another dog licked it, however that's doubtful as most dog I've met aren't that fussy. Its kind of a cool idea but I think a dog biscuit works just as well. One other caveat, it looks like the same bottle that roll-on deodorant comes in so make sure you know for sure what you're smearing on your arm-pits or you could attract some unwanted attention"
positive,"The five stars are from Panda the Puppy.  This thing smells horrible, and looks disgusting, but the puppy loves it. He loves it so much that I can tolerate the horrible smell for him.  Panda loves treats, like most puppies, but this treat in particular gets his attention. It is working as a great training aid too.  He sits, he licks.  It is a treat that he is motivated to work for, and it makes training easier. We do have other treats that work, but this one has the benefit of a fast grab. I don't have to dig in a bag or really search for it."
negative,"My dog was pretty confused when I put this in his face. Whenever I do he'll lick it once or twice then step back and look at me like, ""Can I have a real treat now?"" At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle."
positive,"OK, so my dog loves this and she is a picky eater.  I literally had to force her mouth open and give a roll of it on her tongue and she has been hooked ever since.  I usually only give her high quality treats and chews but I figure a few licks of this roll on won't her her.  I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.  If it was better nutritionally I would have given it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great concept!  I just wish is contained better ingredients.  : )"
positive,"I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!"
positive,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself."
positive,"I have two dogs, one Black Labrador and one Chihuahua.  The Lab can't get enough of this stinky treat and even tries to grab it from me with her teeth.  She will lick on it all day if I let her. The Chihuahua sniffs it and snubs it. She couldn't be less interested. So, one out of two dogs loves this stinky treat.  Humans, on the otherhand, hate the strong smell.  I think it's fun and can imagine it is a great treat substitute for obese dogs who need to watch their calorie intake. If you aren't adverse to strong odors you'll love the handiness of this Lickety Stik!"
positive,"I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!"
negative,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
positive,"My little dog (a Shih Tzu) seemed to have trouble licking the rollerball consistently enough to fully enjoy the treat.  Her inclination was to try to bite the top - and I'm wondering if that's what most dogs would try to do.  Of course, a dog can't tell you in words if they like something - you have to go by behavior.  And when we took this away from our dog, she really didn't protest like she does when it is a favorite treat.<br /><br />The premise behind this product is interesting - and I can understand why the idea of a rollerball made sense.  I'm just not sure it all works together well enough.  I can't envision seeking this out and purchasing it for my pet."
positive,"What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product."
positive,"The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.  I was worried about giving him too many treats because of calories, not to mention the expense.  I started letting him lick the Stik once or twice each time I got the ball away from him.  It didn't take long before he would drop the ball when he saw the Stik, and now he puts it directly into my hand, just so he can lick the Stik. I plan on using it to train him to do other things, as well.<br /><br />Considering how many times I have used it, it is a good value for the money.  It's kind of awkward to give him as a regular dog treat, so I save it for training and give him dog biscuits or other treat."
negative,"First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this ""roll-on"" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it."
positive,"Well, when I ordered this I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it sure wasn't a roll on deodorant container filled with stinky liver flavored liquid.  For me personally, I've always stood by the belief that while the dogs are the one enjoying the dog toys and treats, the are more made for the humans than anything else and there is something totally repugnant about a dog eating from a deodorant container.<br /><br />Jilly, my puppy, loved it.  She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got ""liver breath.""  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.  I have wood floors so no harm no foul, but if you have carpeting you might get a stain, but Jilly helped with the clean up.<br /><br />But I couldn't quite get over the container and even though Jilly loved it the doggy breath and the fact I didn't like her licking a deodorant container was a big turn off.  Plus, if I used roll on deodorant I won't want my dog to associate it with treats, in case she got in the bathroom and ate the real deodorant which I'm sure could make her very sick.<br /><br />3 Stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The cat found this on the table and started pawing at it, so I opened it for her so she could have a lick and she loves it more than the dog!"
negative,"I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs, as I dog train in obedience and in tracking. In the beginning all four were interested, but then they all became frustrated with it. I ended up with $25.00 of this garbage. SAVE YOR MONEY.it's not worth it!"
negative,"My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split."
positive,"I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it."
negative,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""
negative,"My dogs would not lick it or even pay attention to it. I thought it would be great for training as I am a consumate treat ""dropper"", but they were not the least interested. Too bad"
positive,The roller ball was sort of hard to get going. My dogs kept biting the bottle and wouldn't lick it very much. It also had a very strong smell.
positive,This product is great it really works. I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising. I reconmend this product to everyone.
positive,Works great for me and also help me with my weight.  I don't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed.
positive,"I like this product, but I wouldn't use it daily. I learned this the hard way. It is stronger then you think!!!!!"
positive,I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning  it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!
positive,"This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track, Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can."
negative,"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
positive,A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.
positive,"This tea has a superb taste.  I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner.  Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too!  I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it.  Fabulous!"
positive,Reality strikes.  I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years !  It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow!
negative,"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
negative,I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
negative,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
positive,I was very happy with my order.  It arrived on time and as described.  Thank you!!
positive,This is a great spicy rub. I made a bbq brisket with it and combined it with a smokier rub and it turned out incredible. highly recommend. Also used for chicken with equally fantastic results
positive,"This stuff is great to have around.  I won't eat Pizza without it.  It's great for adding some flavor to bland, starchy foods (rice, potatoes, cous-cous).  Also try it on green beans and brocolli.  I brought a can of this to work and now everyone uses it on their food."
positive,"These bars are very tasty.  And I got a low sales price so they were much less overpriced than such bars usually are.  But I consider them to be more like slightly-less-sweet cookies than like health bars -- not that there's anything wrong with that.  They come two thin ones per pouch, so though you get 72 total, there are only 36 pouches.  And most people would consider one pouch to be one serving, so you're getting 36 servings here, not 72.  Also, the bars are extremely crumbly so I suggest having something underneath when you eat them to catch all those crumbs (or have a cordless vacuum handy if you eat these in the car)."
positive,"I've long since been a Nature Valley fan and regularly buy a variety pack at one of my local 'big box' stores but, the price I could get by utilizing the 'subscribe and save' feature was, by far, superior to that of the big box.  They arrived fresh, in date, and 'in tact'.  I must say, I was a bit worried that they'd be granular granola by the time they were shipped/handled but, that simply didn't occur.  Two thumbs up!"
positive,"I can't find these in the grocery store! My family loves these, so I will continue to buy them on Amazon."
positive,"Has a nice apple & cinnamon flavor!!<br /><br />Previous reviewer did not read the description, as it states the bars are in two-packs, and the bars are crunchy.  I break the bars into three pieces before opening the pack, makes it easier to eat.<br /><br />This is one of the harder to find flavors of Nature Valley Granola Bars.  Most of the time you'll see the Oats N Honey, Peanut Butter, and Maple as the only flavors stocked in stores.  I was lucky to find a local grocery which sells these, in addition to the Pecan flavor."
positive,"As a college kid(in a masters program) I appreciate these little bars. They go for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Really awesome taste with milk. I wish they were sold without the plastic packaging(that would be cheaper), or as granola cereal."
positive,My kids really like this one. Just wish Amazon would sell assortments so you don't have to buy so many of each flavor.
positive,"Good Buy for the price. Great with the morning coffee. This is the brittle kind, but this is perfect as a breakfast substitute. I always have a box or two in my office desk. Good buy...and healthy !"
positive,"Ever since I had my first Nature Valley Granola Bar I have never purchased any other brand. I love the fact that they are so crunchy. (My husband likes chewy ones, and he buys his and I buy mine). I always have some in my car in case I get hungry. That way there is no temptation to go to a drive thru for fast food! I have never seen this APPLE flavor before, and I could hardly wait to get the box from AMAZON open. There is NO flavor of NV granola bars I don't like, but this flavor became my instant second ""favorite"" (after Peanut Butter). When I eat these in the car I break the package in thirds cross wise (breaking BOTH of the bars), then I go back and break each to those sections in half lengthwise of the package. Then I split the package open the length of its seam and put it where I can reach it. By doing this I generally get 12 fairly uniform pieces and very few crumbs (which I eat later when the car is not moving). This method works well anywhere you want to eat them and definitely seems to generate far fewer crumbs.<br />I ORDERED THESE AS A SUBSCRIPTION JUST BASED ON HOW GOOD ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS OF NATURE VALLEY ARE.<br />NOTE: Another flavor I have never heard of: Vanilla Nut is listed on Amazon as ""out of stock"" with a place you can sign up to be notified when they are again in stock. They've been rated very well by past Amazon Purchasers so I am waiting with a dripping tongue (my dogs taught me that)."
positive,This is a great tasting product that also came in a very appreciated packagin. I do thank you guys. I will order more when I am running out. No biggie. You all hae a good day. Later.<br /><br />G.
positive,This is a delicious sauce that my entire family loves.  We can't get enough of it.
positive,"I absolutely adore this tea, especially in the summer.  It is very refreshing and caffine free.  This is a nice large package to get you through the season since 1 bag makes about a gallon of ice tea.  The service and shipping was fast...but I didn't get a free pack of Meiji Mini Candy with my order of 2 bags."
positive,I love mugicha and am disappointed that it's so hard to find.  It's great for our kids too -- a healthful alternative to sugary drinks.  My  former Japanese teacher said children and pregnant women in Japan drink it all the time.
negative,This tea was a disappointment. The tea had a weak barley flavor no matter how many tea bags were used. I do not believe this tea was very fresh. I will try another variety.
negative,"I really enjoy the natural decaf property of barley tea. I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching."
negative,"I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water."
positive,"I love this product, and everyone must too, because the prices are going up. I now use it sparingly. More for a treat. That is what I ask for Christmas every year. I hope I get it this yr. 8)"
negative,"If you want to pay a lot for sugar, then buy this box of sugar. No Kiwi was hurt in the production of this so called Kiwi Smoothie, because it does have any Kiwi in it."
positive,The title says it all. The aftertaste tastes stale and not so vanilla-y.  There was a big sugar clump in the jar which made me think moisture got in there at some point.
negative,"Ok.  I've been making a lot of Vietnamese spring rolls at home with peanut sauce; they're surprisingly really easy, but I need a lot of Hoisin to make the peanut sauce.  Ran out of real Hoisin Sauce, and because I didn't have the time to go to the local Asian market, I took a chance with Dynasty (got it at Wal-mart).  The best thing I can say about the Dynasty Hoisin Sauce is that it's a small bottle, so I didn't feel too bad throwing it in the trash.  IT IS REALLY BAD!  There's no way anyone who likes to eat yummy food could possibly rate this sauce over 1 star.  I would give it negative stars if I could because I find it offensive to eat food that tastes so wrong.  I'm completely baffled by the 5 star reviews.  TIA?  Stroke?  Alzheimer's?  Tumor?  There's got to be a reason beyond just not knowing any better.  In my humble opinion, Koon Chun hoisin is the gold standard."
negative,"i received a different brand: brown color Anateon something like that. that brand is not great, all stuck together. i dont know if the picture showed is different brand. it's worth it!"
positive,"Don't get me wrong, these pistachios are fantastic.  Though, it's something that I've never thought of... but these nuts are not salted.  Antep pistachios are great, but when you take away the salt, they're just not as addictive.  I'm still going to eat them, I just won't horde them all to myself like I used to.  From now on, make sure you order your turkish pistachios with salt.  It makes all the difference in the world."
positive,"I like this cereal over all the other ones out there, so I gave it 5 stars.  You pick up the box and can just tell it has more substance to it.  A lot of cereals show plenty of fruit and nuts on the picture on the outside of the box, but then the actual cereal has very litte.  This Quaker cereal is different and I hope they don't cheapen it over time like the others are doing.<br />But $21 for a 56 ounce box????  Are they out of their mind??!!  One 28 oz box cost $4.50 in the grocery store, so 56 oz would cost $9.  Where do they get off charging $12 more is a mystery to me.  Unless I'm reading this incorrectly, and they are selling several 56 oz boxes for $21.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/1/2012: I see they have reduced the price from $21 to $11.24.  But it's still not $9 like it would be at the store, and what would shipping add to it?"
positive,excellent salame - it is a luxury product that will make you throw rocks at ordinary dry salami.  I will order it for my next special occaision.
negative,"This salami is not what I am used to when I buy Genoa salami.  Too much fat, great lumps of fat in the meat which I took out one at a time before eating what was left.  Very greasy.  Threw it all away in disgust.  Would not recommend to my friends."
positive,"After having gastric bypass, I find that I really miss the ""crunch"" of crackers. After looking for a good whole grain cracker with low or no sugar, and low in carbs, I stumbled across this cracker and decided to try it. I AM SOLD!! This cracker is just what the right cracker. Its made of all healthy ingredients, all good grains. Yes it has carbs, but they are healthy carbs and only 10 grams for 2 crackers, which are good size cracker. I will eat 2 or 3 crackers with cheese or tuna, or sometimes peanut butter (for the protein) and I am full.<br /><br />I took the package to my doctor, and he said it was a good healthy cracker. Its great for anyone with diabetes too!!I now order them by the case from amazon. I am glad to find this cracker and its now the only one I will eat."
positive,"I always loved the Finn Crisp Rye w/o Caraway Seeds, but I had to order the Multigrain b/c they were out of the rye ones. Now I've got some of the rye again and I realize--I love the Multigrain! Maybe they changed the recipe for the rye ones--they're almost like sawdust when you chew them. The Multigrain ones are so yummy--you can just grab a couple and munch on them for a snack. They have a very slightly sweet taste, like whole grain products often do, but they go well with everything. My favorite thing to top them with is plain cream cheese with salt and pepper. If you like healthy foods and want an easy way to be good to your diet, buy these!"
positive,A healthy snack option.Such as great taste!You should definitely have the courage to try it.I'm eating one while writing this...
positive,"I have known and enjoyed Finn Cisp for almost three decades, because I was able to buy it in Germany. I now live in AZ and was not able to buy it here.<br />I was so glad to learn that I could order through Amazon.com. I love the product because of its taste and it's low calory and fat content. My whole family and many of our friends love it too. I now order it through Amazon's subscription thereby taking advantage of lower prices  and free shipping.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSQG"">Finn Crisp Multigrain Thin Crisp, 6.2 Oz Boxes (Pack of 9)</a>"
positive,"I first had this bouillon in Switzerland and LOVED it and brought some home with me.  It is hands down the best vegetable bouillon - adds so much flavor to soups, vegetables and dips etc.  It is organic  too- Yea! I was thrilled to see that Amazon carries it!  I am about to order a case now.  Thank you Amazon!"
positive,"The boullion has a great flavor, albeit salty. It is saltier than other vegetable boullions that I have used (Repunzel is my favorite).<br /><br />I was very disappointed that the sell-by date on my six-pack is April 2012 (purchased January 2012). I suspect that this product has been sittting on the shelf for many months unless it has an end-date that is only a few months from the manufacture date.<br /><br />While I understand that I will still be able to use the boullion after April, as reviewers of other products have noted sometimes Amazon's food items are not fresh. Sigh - one of the perils of purchasing perishible items on-line.<br /><br />I subtracted one star for excessive saltiness and one for the closeness to the sell-by date."
negative,"but it isn't very flavorful.  a friend suggested it and i jumped on it when amazon got it back in stock.  i do like that it is made with vegetable products but i won't buy it again.  shoot, i have enough for the next ten years!"
positive,I believe this is one of the best deals to buy PG Tips in bulk.  My package arrived on time in good condition.  I'm pleased with the product and service.
negative,"I was expecting a lot form England's No 1 tea. If you like the Black tea Lipton tea bags then you may like this product. I find this one very bland, mild, no taste, no color. The tea in the bags is like powder."
positive,"This is legitimate cassis, just like in France.  It is definitely worth buying, except for the price.  The price Amazon is selling this for is a bit high."
negative,"This was not as strongly flavored as I was hoping, If you want something with only a HINT of spice than this is for you. I had to end up adding a tbls of pumpkin pie spice to the coffee filter when I brewed a cup. The was a total wast of money & time"
positive,My cat is on this special diet. Works great...she has been UTI free for over a year. But I can purchase this from my vet for about $47 for a 17.6 pound bag. So before purchasing here shop around...I have also found other websites that sale for $60 or less.
negative,This basket was absolutely not worth the $40.00 that it cost. I was humiliated when my boss opened it. There were also items missing from the basket. It was quite tacky.
negative,"The items in this basket collectively are worth about $10. Not quite sure what I was expecting when I bought this. The gloves are something out of the 70's, gummi worms (50 cents?), stale cookies ($1?), seeds ($3 on Amazon!), and some tea (~$5?). This is way overpriced for what was delivered."
positive,This is a great gift. I was looking for something different for my wife for Mother's Day. This was perfect. Shipment was very fast. I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased from Amazon.
positive,We have 2 labradors and these are the best chew toys.  Box of 90 bones last 4-5 months.  This is great.  It takes them 1-2 hours to finish.  Can keep them busy if they chew a few minutes at a time.
positive,"I have two medium size dogs that love to chew and these rawhides are awesome!  The 6"" bones last a few hours which is a few hours of serenity for us!"
positive,"My dog loves these rawhide bones. He's a black lab mix and it takes him a an hour and a half of pure chewing to get through one. You can tell that the bones are quality rawhide and thoroughly pressed (always a plus!)<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that each bone had a tag. A small issue, but only takes two seconds to take all of them off. (Just silly to waste paper I guess.)<br /><br />In total, these bones are worth it and will not break into little pieces on the floor. I will certainly buy these again in the future!"
positive,Great price on these pressed bones.<br />My dogs love em! The bones arrived<br />within a couple of days and were in<br />great shape. Will be ordering more!
negative,"Don't feed Rawhides, they are unhealthy.<br />Sadly, rawhide bones are very dangerous to dogs. While some dogs go their entire lives scarfing down the fun-to-chew treats, they can be deadly. Rawhides can be full of bacteria and poisons. Aside from what is in rawhide, dogs can choke on them or sustain intestinal blockage from ingesting them.<br /><br />Rawhides often come from less developed countries. This means that the hides are transported over poor roads and without refrigeration, before they cleaned and dried. Under these conditions, they can grow salmonella which can kill your dog. It is also unsafe for humans, especially small children, to handle. The problem has been so serious that in 1999 the FDA to issued a warning on the subject stating ""These products may pose a risk of bacterial infection such as Salmonella...FDA is urging pet owners who have these products to handle them carefully. Anyone who comes in contact with these treats should wash their hands with hot water and soap. Elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk from exposure and should avoid any contact with these chews.""<br /><br />Read up."
positive,"I bought this to make a cornbread recipe. Coconut flour and cornmeal makes a cornbread where you don't know if it is a cake or a bread, you only know you want more of it. It is a recommended item for those wanting less wheat in their diet.  Trying coconut flour recipes is a total delight."
positive,"I like the natural sweetness and high fiber content of this flour. I am using it in gluten free recipes in place of sweet brown rice flour, until I can purchase that.  So far the cookies made with it have come out well. It's also great to use in pancakes.  The key is only to use a little of the flour. Too much c. flour in any recipe probably won't have the results you would prefer."
negative,How does $ 8.99 for 16 oz....calculate out to 12 cents an ounce? this marketing doesn't make a bit of sense. My math says this is 57 cents an ounce. What gives?
positive,"Fat Cat makes the most imaginative toys for cats. They entertain me as well! The cat nip in the toy is an attraction to the cats as well as the feathered tickle ones, making my indoor cats feel like they are hunters. They even make my floor look cute when it is cluttered with cat toys!"
positive,"My cat loves these lures, especially the one with the red fuzzy hair.  I only wish the fishing pole itself lasted as long.  Oh well."
negative,I bought these extra lures for the broken cat toy that I purchased with these. My cat likes the fluffy hair on the one butterfly character but once he ripped it all out the fun was over. ...meh.
positive,My 2 year old sons loves this powder.  He actually takes it with water vs. juice.  I am happy to know my picky eater is able to get his vitamins for the day.
positive,"I used this oil as the fat for homemade pie crust, as well as adding 2-4 tablespoons to pumpkin pie batter for additional richness, and a deeper pumpkin flavor!  Its awesome, and adds a unique color to the crust."
positive,"This arrived yesterday and so far I've only tried it once, which made a great dressing for watercress and cabbage.  When you bite into the dressed salad, there is a brief moment when you can taste the pumpkin flavor.<br /><br />The bottles are very tiny, and the plastic seal which you pull to open seems secure.  There was no leakage.<br /><br />The oil is a very dark greenish/reddish color.  I know it sounds like an implausible combination of colors, but that's what it looked like to me.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying the suggestion of drizzling it on ice cream.  Look forward to using this oil with other foods and in other ways.<br /><br />It's nice we can order these from amazon as the local Whole Foods only has the walnut oil and pecan oil from this brand, but does not carry the pumpkin seed oil.<br /><br />I might try this brand's walnut oil next, as it is significantly cheaper than the pumpkin seed oil."
positive,"The oil is quite tasty, though not quite as strong as some of the pumpkin seed oil that I ate when I lived in Austria. The price is much better than some of the others, especially when using subscribe and save. I love this on salads with balsamic vinegar."
negative,"I found these cheese snacks just terrible.... they smell like dog treats and taste like, what i would imagine... dog treats to taste like.. I whole-heartedly implore you to avoid these snacks."
negative,"I like white cheddar.  I can eat half a pound of it at one sitting.  I like soy.  I can chug plain varieties of it by the quart.<br /><br />But 'Just the Cheese Rounds, Cheddar Plus Soy' as a snack?  It's hard to get down one of these calcified nuggets, let alone a portion.<br /><br />As an added bonus, an aftertaste will naturally curb your appetite for hours."
positive,Peanut oil is good for baking and frying. It does not have an odor in baking and it does not easily burn at high temperatures when frying. I am just a regular house wife who likes to cook. Peanut oil does not make my house stink. I used to be afraid of frying because of the smell but that has changed. I am more willing to fry now. I tried to find peanut oil in regular grocery stores but couln't. Costco used to carry it but not any more. I ordered through Amazon.com and I am very happy with the purchase.
negative,"This is a GREAT product.  Use it all the time, but don't buy it here for $168!!!!  You can get it elsewhere, including Sam's Club, for less than $35.  Same size, same company, same everything for way less than half the price!!!!"
negative,"Like a lot of people, I guess, I got scared of chicken jerky made in China. Even though I used a very respectable brand that's sold broadly in every major chain (Dogswell), I still felt a little queasy. So I bought this stuff, which is made in Colorado. Colorado! What better state for dogs than Colorado? Great terrain changes, fresh air, active residents--boy, was this jerky gonna be great. Only it wasn't. It was rock-hard. My Havanese are 15 and 18 pounds, so there's no way they're getting a whole strip; i break off pieces. I cannot do so with this product, except to break a strip in half. The only reason this product didn't get one star is that my dogs seem to like whatever bite-sized pieces I'm able to create by using a hammer."
positive,"Another Cristmas present for the lady of the house. She just told me that it's some of the most excellent tea she's had. Too bad we can't buy this in the stores around here. Ah well, we will keep purchasing it from AMAZON until it comes this way."
positive,"When I saw this soup on the shelf at the store, I was immediately interested. I love Thai food. The flavor is nice without being overwhelming. I find no need to add any additional spices or seasoning. A nice soup for a rainy day like today. Warm and comforting."
negative,"I've NEVER seen such small cans of Chunky Soup. You know, Campbell's Chunky soup has been sold since the 1970s and in that time I've seen only one size of can. This is not the usual double but a SINGLE SERVING CAN! If you think you're getting a good deal, THINK AGAIN and compare the can size."
negative,I've been noticing recently that this and all their chunky soups are becoming more and more watered down.<br /><br />That and the incremental downsizing of their products(as with just about everything else in the grocery store) means I'll be passing their section of the soup aisle. Time to make my own I guess.
negative,"Every single can of soup in my order was dented. Not just slightly, but as if someone had taken each can and personally threw it on the cement before they shipped it to me."
negative,It is my own fault that I didn't realize I always buy the 18.8 ounce and this is only 10.75 ounce cans. (I've never even seen them in this small of a size). I only buy them on sale so the price per can for the 10.75 ounce is more than I normally buy the 18.8 ounce for.  Amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap.
negative,These cans wound up being about $1.83 a can. And they're not even a full can of soup. I should have read the size closer- but this is almost like scamming. Not right to do to customers!!!!
positive,I was happy with this product.  It had a nice flavor and had a great price!
positive,While many believe that A id better than B grade I find the B grade maple syrup very rich.  It has more flavor than the A and is excellent to use in both baking and with roasted fowl and pork.
positive,"Arrived soon enough, last for a pretty long time, tastes good and it is good for you. Will buy again."
positive,Great price for a very good quality syrup. It really has a deep and full maple syrup flavor. Not dull or wishy washy.
positive,"This maple syrup is excellent in taste and economy. We do not use any of the processed syrups on the market and to find a great real maple syrup at an affordable price is really tough.  This Organic Maple Syrup from NOW has it all...price, ease of ordering and best of all wonderful flavor with nothing added.  I'm buying another jug soon."
positive,"I bought this maple syrup for the master cleanse diet but then ended up eating it for some healthy pancakes and boy o boy is this syrup super yummy!!!!  My 2 and 4 year olds love it.  Also, the price is great!"
negative,"If I could put zero stars I would!<br /><br />I purchased two 64-fl oz containers of pure maple syrup from Nutricity through Amazon. The product was fine. Then without ever using it, I decided I wanted to return it for a refund. I printed the return authorization and the shipping label from the Amazon website, paid an extra $15 for shipping, and sent the items back. About two weeks later I got an email from Nutricity stating that their policy is no refunds on grocery items, and if I wanted the product back I would have to pay for shipping back to me. That's fine if that's their policy, but it was not clearly stated, and if that is their policy, I should not have been able to print a return authorization from the Amazon website. I feel like I have been ripped off. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!<br /><br />Save yourself the headache, and just buy this from someone else!"
positive,"This is really good maple syrup, packed with flavor, dense, and dark. Naturally it takes homemade waffles and pancakes to the next level, but it can also add a dash of magic to other breakfast staples, such as oatmeal or muffins. It is hard to imagine how commercial syrups laden with artificial flavors, colors, and other content can even be marketed as syrup---this is the real deal."
positive,"I'm from Maine and I have to tell you that I would never buy grade A maple syrup. If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of ""grade A"" as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor. By the way, for baking and real maple syrup afficionados, there is also a grade C (even darker)!"
positive,This has a nice full flavor. i thought that since this isn't made in Vermont it wouldn't be very good but it's just fine.
positive,"If you are thinking of doing the Master Cleanse, this is the product you are looking for.  It is reasonably priced, high quality and exactly fits all the specifications they recommend.  One note, if you are going to do the full 10 days you will either need 2 or an additional 32 oz. I personally liked it as a table syrup as well.  It's the ""stout"" of maple syrups."
positive,"Due to dietary restrictions, I cannot use this myself. However I sent this to my sister in Germany as part of her Christmas present. She absolutely RAVED about it!"
positive,"Based on the other 2 reviews I chose to give this brand of syrup a try.  WOW, it has a deep, rich, buttery flavor and aroma.  My husband has been wanting pancakes just so he can eat the syrup! I've used it for a Master Cleanse and don't know if it's the quality of the syrup or what, but have had better success with detoxing using this than a Grade A or other brand of Grade B (this is my 3rd MC).  I look forward to using this for breakfast and baking, I will reorder again and recommend to friends and family! It would make a great gift in a gourmet gift basket!"
negative,"This looks like a better deal than it REALLY is, and I wonder how many people who actually did the math for themselves would truly be pleased.<br /><br />This product is listed as 64 ounces, for a cost of $39.75, and they break it down as $0.41 per ounce. This would be a fantastic deal.<br /><br />HOWEVER, $39.75 for 64 ounces means this costs over $0.62 per ounce! This is not cool. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but it's bad business."
positive,"This is a nice way to go if you need maple syrup in bulk, like in order to do the Master Cleanse, like I did. It will last you nearly a week.  It is not too sweet, so you don't get a headache if you put a little too much on your pancakes, either.... wait - Is there such a thing as too much syrup on pancakes? No."
positive,I have done the master cleanse several times and the last time I used Now's grade B syrup instead of buying it at our local health food store to save money.  It tastes great but I have health problems and the last few times I've done the cleanse I have felt really bad and I assume that is why and not because of the quality of the syrup. I only mention it in order to give an honest review...But as I said it tastes great so I assume if it were inferior it wouldn't..
positive,"I've ordered this syrup 4 times now and I use it for the Master Cleanse.  Tastes great and can be used for ""regular"" syrup as well."
positive,"Non-GE - ""GE"" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be ""instant gratification"" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products"
positive,"It's grade-B maple syrup. I used it for some Christmas recipes. It was sticky and smelled and tasted of maple, and was (presumably) not made out of some unknown substance that fell to earth, possibly from space. I trust that a health-food company would sell the genuine article so advertised. Perhaps naive of me, but I was willing to take that leap of faith this time.<br /><br />Only gripe: the blue cap arrived broken. There was a silvery plastic seal across the top, much like you would find on a bottle of salad dressing, so the syrup stayed in place. I would not, however, recommend using the syrup as salad dressing. Unless you're into that kind of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. You freak."
positive,I can tell you it arrived in good shape and in good timing.  We have not opened it yet though.
negative,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS IT APPEARS! THE BOTTLE IS TINY, BUT LOOKS LIKE A STANDARD 32oz BOTTLE, IN THE PICTURE! If you fall for the picture, as I did, without paying attention to the fluid oz. size, then you end up paying 30 dollars for a 32oz. bottle, which normally sells for under 20 dollars. Legal but very deceptive....BOYCOTT these Charlatans!"
negative,"What does Non-GE mean?<br />One of the most annoying things about Amazon, whether the product be sold by them or through them, are the incomplete descriptions.<br />  The information would be helpful to potential buyers and therefore to the seller.  Incomplete descriptions only lead me to ask: what are they hiding, or, are they trying to dump something on the unsuspecting?"
positive,"Product is listed as flaxseeds and that's what I received however, I was interested in flaxseed meal, as indicated in the product description."
positive,"This ginger is very tasty on its own, with sushi, and with any seafood. I signed up for the Subscribe and Save program for this item, which gives 15% off the price and allows you to choose how often you want to receive the product (no obligation, no shipping charges.) Initially, I indicated 6 months, but my daughter and I ran out of it in a little more than a month, so I changed the order to be delivered every month. In addition, there is a promotion until March 31, 2010, which allows you to save an additional 10% (bringing it to 25% off) if you use the promo code ROLAND77"
negative,"I purchased 8 jars based on reviews I read.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the ginger compared to what I get in restaurants and what I buy at the store.  The ginger was much thicker that what I considered normal and not the ""pink"" color I was expecting.  The taste also was not what I consider to be ""premium"".  Maybe I just got a sub standard batch, but I definitely would not reorder this product."
negative,"When most reviews are so  good, I tend to be suspect of the  rare poor one. Unfortunately, after trusting the good reviews (and figuring the negative one was an outlyer of sorts), I purchased this ginger.  Extremely disappointed!  It is very thick - which to me is not a problem. But, it is unusually hot...I've never had HOT ginger before (spicy -yes,fire HOT- no).  Moreover, the balance of the spices/ingredients is just weird, leading to a very nasty bitter... almost chemical, lingering aftertaste, which I'm attributing to possibly (??) the type of or an overuse of preservative, since the nasty aftertaste isn't consistent with any of the common ingredients. If you must, try it for yourself (as did I), but be forewarned. Hopefully, I'll be able to send it back and get my return shipping reimbursed. This is NOTHING like the wonderful ginger served in a restaurant with sushi."
positive,"For the most part, I really like this ginger. I would, however, encourage the company to use glass jars rather than plastic. I just don't trust plastic jars. In fact, I went ahead and emptied out all eight jars into one large, glass Mason jar. We go through ginger pretty quickly, so I'm not worried about it spoiling."
negative,"For those who like ginger, this product is fine on its own merits. However, for sushi, the product is not appropriate. For one thing, the slices are really thick and large which completely overwhelms the sushi flavour. Ginger is a supposed to be a complement to the sushi meal. The ginger should be thinly sliced, almost translucent. This is something else which is fine for other meals. For instance, I dice the slices for my other dishes."
positive,"I loved this product!!  I made sushi using the Sushezi and it came out great!!  For me, the ginger is the essential ingredient to finish the sushi. It can be a little thickly cut, but for me, this is not bothersome.  I will definitely order this again."
positive,"I ran across this item while browsing for something else.  I like to have pickled ginger with my tossed salad, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The pros:<br />+  Low cost, which includes the shipping!<br />+  Fast shipping & it comes very well packed.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  My first impression was that the slices were too thick & way too large... real big pieces that need to be cut or you'd get more than a mouth full!<br />-  The taste at first is pleasant, but then it gets hot... not really bad, but the odd aftertaste was a turnoff.<br /><br />I'm sure some will like the taste, but I was happy when the last bottle was empty! :("
negative,"I have been eating Sushi and Ginger for over 25 years and this is the worst Sushi Ginger I have ever tasted. Unfortunately, my entire family feels the same way and we're stuck with 8 jars of this stuff..."
negative,"Received this ginger in the mail and at least two of the bottles were leaking.  The 'liner' used beneath the lids does not appear to be sealed well at all, on any of the bottles.  We were actually a little nervous about even eating any of the bottles.  After going through and tossing several, we decided to keep the remainder and re-package them in canning jars to help preserve them.  The ginger is sliced fairly thick and we have to cut it down to make it managable for eating on our sushi.  All in all, the flavor is decent, but a lot of tedious work to get to that point.  In the future, we will either can our own or try and find a local carrier to buy our sushi ginger."
negative,"The seller states in the product description that the quantity of Kefir grains will be enough to make one cup of milk. The amount I received was just over a teaspoon and the seller's directions which came with it said to put it in a quarter of a cup of milk. The grains seemed rather delicate and I've been ""babying"" them for about a week now and still haven't been able to make a cup of Kefir. Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else. That being said, I have been able to make Kefir--albeit in doll portions---and the flavor is good."
negative,"Seller talks about growing kefir is like art, but the kefir that i got from him was flat. After readind on ""DOM'S KEFIR"" site i believe the grain was squeezed by the ""Seller"" ouch !"
positive,First batch arrived flat and dead. Could not revive.<br />  Second batch revived OK.
positive,"I bought grains from the Amazon seller ""Drybyma Treasures"" about a month and a half ago. I received them in 3 days, and they took about 3 days to recover from their ordeal in the mail, producing some very nasty sour-milk-tasting stuff the first day and some very yeasty-tasting stuff the second two days. But their fourth attempt was delicious and by now they've fully recovered and are reproducing like mad. Drybyma sent about 2 tablespoons of grains in the original package, but in a couple of weeks I had half a cup and a week after that I had almost a full cup of grains. I've had to give some grains away and eat some in order to keep the population down.<br /><br />The grains looked like cottage cheese curds when they first arrived. But then they started producing noodle-like shapes and recently began producing tiny cauliflower shapes. It's interesting how they develop.<br /><br />The kefir they produce tastes similar to the kefir I used to buy at my neighborhood Whole Foods store. Sometimes it's more tart than other times, and thickness also varies. I've used both Jersey milk and goat's milk. The thickest, mildest kefir I've made was with raw light cream.<br /><br />Unfortunately Drybyma doesn't seem to be selling kefir grains at the moment. Perhaps they sold out and need to rebuild their stock. Hopefully they'll return so other shoppers can enjoy their product. I can't really rate any other seller's kefir grains because quality can vary."
negative,"I don't think the seller, greenyoung, could have possibly sent a smaller amount of kefir.  will buy from another supplier."
negative,"The grains I got didn't look like the one you see on the pic. The one I got had to come from Antarctida bec they were yellow (probably they were frozen before)they also not growing...the amount I got was invisible to my eyes, I complain to the seller so they send me a little more grains but they were still yellow and kind of dead bec they didnt grow. If you want to waste $10 and some time go for it!!! I would really recommend to order it somewere else."
negative,"I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem? At any rate, I love, love, love kefir as do my kittykats."
negative,"This is my first experience ordering kefir grains and growing them.  It seemed to me that<br />the shipping and handling charge were rather high for such a small amount (size of a<br />walnut or less.)  Also the directions should have come with the grains - not 6 days later<br />via email. Why so much later?  By then I had already handled them following directions<br />from my son who had recommended a source for them.  So, I was not pleased.<br />Carolyn Hocker, Newville, PA."
negative,The Kefir grains arrive in good shape and packaged very well.  I used them in raw goat milk but did not have great success.  I did send an e-mail to the seller but never had a reply.  I eventually discarded the grains.
positive,"Grains came very quickly. Produce great tasting kefir and multiply like rabbits. My girlfriend and I have been selling our new grains to locals and giving them away to family and friends. In about 1 months, we had 8x as many grains as we started with."
positive,I got the Kefir from BIGGIRL22 and received it in 2 days from the order.  The grains were plump and practically ready to go!
positive,"I have been following directions for about a month with the kefir I received--which by the way was a very miniscule amount, looked to be a little less than a teaspoon!  It does something--resulting in curds resembling cottage cheese, but so far I see nothing like translucent ""kefir grains"" developing. I have an excellent source of fresh raw cows milk and I've tried 24 and 48 hour culturing.  I've tried draining it using a plastic can colander and straining it in a regular plastic colander.  Maybe kefirs vary from source to source.  I am still new at this.  So far I just mix part of the curds into already made yogurt and put the rest back into the jar to make more of this stuff. I did appreciate the referral to Dom's site"
positive,"I made the mistake of putting too much milk in the jar the first time I made kefir with these grains (old habit) but thought, what the heck, it won't hurt the grains. In 24 hours I strained the milk out of the grains and added just less than a pint (about 12 ounces) of milk to them the second time (I drank the slightly soured milk from the first batch--not bad) Within 24 hours that short pint had turned into the thickest, smoothest, yummiest kefir ever! I've made 2 more batches since and the last one was with 3 cups of milk. Absolutely perfect. I'm convinced that my next batch will do a full quart. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />PS: I use a low heat pasteurized milk. I would not recommend using regular pasteurized milk and absolutely DO NOT use ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk will work but only for the first and maybe second batch as the wild bacteria in the raw milk compete with the kefir grains. If you use raw milk then always let your kefir grains renew themselves in some pasteurized milk."
positive,"I purchased these grains a few weeks back. There weren't very many in the small plastic envelope and I wasn't sure how this would turn out. Well, They are finally multiplying and I was able to get a first decent batch yesterday. They still have a long ways to go to produce a pint or two a day but at least they were alive and are doing well. I expected more for the money, but in the end, I got what I wanted."
positive,"The live kefir grains are amazing! I received them quickly and they were packed in a sanitary and tightly sealed manner. I am extremely satisfied with this product. They are performing better than my expectations, thank you amazon.com<br />I was very leary about buying online. Amazon.com has shone me otherwise."
positive,I've made a new batch of kefir via these seeds every day for 2 1/2 years or so and have shared the extra seeds with many. So far so good!
positive,"These arrived as described. I got them into milk as soon as I could and they have responded very nicely. After about 3 days, as I have replaced the milk about every 12 hours, they've grown and seem to be doing very well."
positive,"These Kefir grains were very much alive when they arrived, about 1/2 tsp, still moist...after 3 feedings...they grew, and grew!!  I have had other grains that have died off.<br />Highly recommend!!"
positive,Arrived very fresh and ready to go. I had kefir within 48 hours. Tasty and healthy it is now a regular part of our diet.
negative,"ive had kefir grains in the past and these were never solid.  there was not a clump that I could strain out to save for the next batch.  I tried working with it to make it work hoping they would ""grow"" so I could have a  grain to strain out.  this never happened.  when i wrote them about it they said i was past 90 days.  well i guess i shouldn't have spent so long trying to make it work."
negative,"My grains are dead. Where the heck do I contact these people to send me a knew one? Poor packaging. 2 teaspoons worth of Kefir. No instructions. Please send me some new kefir, thanks."
negative,I am really dissapointed with the product. I received less than half a teaspoon. I has been really hard to make then to work. I've had kefir pearls before. I know how to take care of them. I would not reccomend this seller. Try a different one.
positive,"Excellent! The  ""grains"" arrived quickly. I read the easy to follow directions and then got to work. My friends, these""grains"", moved fast. I quickly had two then four cups of kefir. For two people, we are getting plenty of kefir. In fact, I regularly put the starter jar in the refrigerator to slow the growth down. My ""grains"" have grown, so I now have a dehydrated  batch of grains, in case something goes wrong. The kefir is delicious! The kefir ""grains"" are happy and we are happy. Very pleased with the product and the supplier!"
positive,"I just received our kefir grains in the mail.  There was about a tsp of healthy looking grains.  After 12 hours of doing what the instructions said, the grains already doubled in size.  Very, very happy with this seller!"
negative,I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or if the kefir grains I have are not any good. I've had the milk grains for about 3 weeks and I'm following the directions exactly. The grains are actually growing but every batch that I've made has that rotten sour milk taste.  Any tips that anybody might have that could save this batch or do I just chuck these and start a new?  The water grains I got you are doing great.
positive,I bought these to avoid paying high prices for kefir in the store when I could culture it myself. I've been culturing my own kefir for over 3 months now and have been able to share grains with family and friends. I have no reservations recommending this product!
positive,I was happy with the product but i paid extra to get it here fast (a lot extra) and i think it took 5 days:(. whats the point of 2 day shipping it if you don't get it in 2?
negative,The amount of kefir grains was tiny. I ended up pitching them. They might be fine for those with the patience to grow them -- I wanted more than a few teaspoons of kefir.
positive,"I am really happy about this KEFIR GRAINS because they are very strong and potent, Just after 3 weeks their population will reach to double and after 4 weeks I could make 1 liter Kefir every 24 hours."
negative,"The picture of the K-cup shows ""Extra Bold"" but received ""Light Roast"" !Very disappointed !Maybe that's why the price was lower than others. Be careful ordering."
positive,"K-cup decaf was as described, and it came with surprising promptness.  We've ordered from this company before and always found it satisfactory."
negative,"My mom didn't like these the one year I bought them for her for mother's day. She really likes tea too. Wouldn't get this again. Admoittedly, they look somewhat off-putting."
positive,"The first time I gave my cats this cat nip, I put a little on their toys, scratching post and left to go to work, (my usual routine if I leave for more than a few hours). When I cam home,late that day, my most lazy and independent cat, Luna would not stop following me around. He cried and purred and wanted to be on my lap and in general, acted super weird. I phoned my husband in a panic - I was so sure he was ill! We retraced Luna's day together - I had forgotten about the new 'nip- My husband started laughing..""He's stoned!"" What? ""It's the new Catnip!"" Oh. That was the only new thing and Luna was just super happy.<br />Well, I started giving waaaaay less catit nip in the morning before leaving or whenever, and now they are more normal, but even the other guy, Besos, actually climbs into the csbinet to try to find the catit 'nip if I don't give them some! They are acting younger again! they have never loved 'nip before, just kind of played with it, ate it and acted like, hey this stuff is pretty good, thanks.... Now they ask for it. Cute! Get some, but don't give too much the first time!"
positive,Everyone around here chews gum but I wanted to get something that had some flavor (this has great flavor if you love sour apple) and that I could pop bubbles with. I have fond memories carrying and enjoying big league bubble gum as a kid and 20 something years later it's just as much fun.<br />The boss came out of his office to see who kept popping bubbles and we all stopped chewing and went back to our normal routines.<br />It was like our parent getting on to us but we fooled him....this time.
positive,"It seems like a pheonem deal and you saying, yeah i wont regret this. Tastes like crap after the second pack."
negative,I am no bimbo but I don't want my teeth to fall out? I got visit Dentist almost twice a year and its not exactly enriching to see item without sugar content and fat content and calories per serving? Is this a fake product?
positive,"Great Taste, No Corn Syrup and No Refrigeration after opening. This is the best syrup to flavor your coffee because it is naturally sweet with sugar and not corn syrup."
positive,This is the only chocolate syrup product I can find on the shelf at my local grocery store that contains NO SOY and NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. I like how it tastes and how it mixes easily with milk.
negative,Not that great. I was really looking foward to receiveing these when they came in I try a few and there just nothing to write home about. I can think of several company that make better chocolate.
positive,I have been purchasing these at Walmart for 3.68 per package.  They have the texture of home-style noodles and taste great.
positive,"If your dog loves peanut butter, it will love SmartBones Peanut Butter Dog Chew. I purchased the 8-pack Mini and is my dog JJ's favorite treat. Product should be offered in larger quantities, maybe 12 to 24 in a package as they don't last long in our house!"
positive,My dogs love these and so much easier on them than rawhide bones.  I buy these all the time!  And they love peanut butter flavor!
negative,"The price is good, size is perfect...but my dog doesn't like them at all. Would not buy again sorry. Not the products fault"
positive,"My dogs recognize the package & the sound of the tear-off top. As soon as they get a whiff of that peanut-butter flavor, they start dancing & prancing around me!  I''ve gotten these before - the only negative part is the dogs snarf these up too fast!"
positive,"My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!"
positive,These are the best bones for your dogs.  No rawhide and my labs love them.  Well work the money.  I have been ordering these for about 3months now and always a great transaction.  Delievery has arrived either on time or early. A++++++++++++++++++
negative,"I was ready to buy it, but passed it up. Why? Because it has corn syrup in it. Corn syrup has been linked to obesity and diabetes. For all the benefits of pomegranate juice, you lose it with the corn syrup."
positive,"Just to be clear- this is not authentic French onion soup.<br /><br />I've made the real thing- versions that require a few days and a lot of beef to make the stock, and those are delightful if one has the time and money and dedication.<br /><br />This kit is for when one does NOT have that time, money, and dedication. It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils.<br /><br />However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce).<br /><br />I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic ""croutons"",and my family liked it very much.<br /><br />Sauteed browned mushrooms would be an excellent addition, which I will do if I make this again!"
negative,I made the French Onion soup and Didn't care much for it. Maybe I put to much onion in it.
positive,"We have used Tom Douglas' rubs for years now.  I first found them at a winery on the east side of Washington state.  Nice to see them available on Amazon with the free shipping.  I love the masala, I cook with chicken breast, with ginger and cilantro, remove chicken, then add either coconut milk or 1/2n1/2 with chicken broth (also some cashews sauted in sesame oil on the side).  I agree with the other reviewer not too spicy but lots of flavor.<br /><br />For more spicy hot, I use the Tokoyo rub in my steak fajitas and use the Peri Peri on chicken cooked on the grill for spicy chicken sandwiches."
positive,"You get a ton of pretzels in this bag, and it is allergy friendly! Perfect for my son with allergies, and all his non-allergy friends love them, too! Great for a snack at school or on the way to practice. I'd highly recommend these pretzels in any form, but I love the mini bags for convenience now that my son is older."
positive,"My 1 and 3 yr old boys brought these home from day care.  My husband and I tried them and ate them all up!  I'm not really a pretzel fan but these don't taste so ""yeasty"" and actually have a slight sweet flavor.  The 1oz bag is a perfect size; you get a lot in this one bag!  Really good and am looking to buy these to take to work for a healthy snack."
positive,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019Z6ES2"">Redbarn Bully Stick 35 Count 7 inch</a><br /><br />Malcolm, our rescue Cairn Terrier (the HAIRIER terrier) loves to chew. I mean REALLY REALLY REALLY loves to chew. He doesn't go after ""hard targets"" like wood furniture, but he did destroy the ""mattress"" in his dog bed. He is trying to figure out how to chew our cats without hurting them. They do not like his experimentation.<br />Found Bully Bones at a Petco, he was on the first one, dashed off to a defensible corner, and chewed his silly head off!! (Not literally.) But when he starts trying to chew the cats, we know his stick is gone, and he needs another one. So I buy them in bulk.<br />Did I mention he has BEAUTIFUL teeth - vet said keep letting him chew them. There is nothing here to clean."
positive,"Aegean olive oil from Kalamata olives has a wonderful nutty flavor. There is no bitterness, even when the oil is not used quickly. My family loves it in salad dressing, pasta dishes and especially as a dipping oil with cracked pepper and wonderful Greek bread. Great price..well worth the money. Enjoy!"
negative,"The actual product is fine.  It's recommended by my vet and I gobble it up daily.  I prefer my owner's food but she's stingy with it so I have no choice.  I even enjoy it at times.  My human was thrilled to order it in Feb 2009 and have it show up on our doorstep (no hauling of heavy bag in and out of car) and it was actually slightly cheaper than if she'd bought it from our local pet megalomart chain store.  I don't like the megalomart all that much.  The floors are slippery and they make my nervous.  But then again, I do like to watch the ferrets.  Oh, little ferret, squeeze your squirmy body of of that glass case. I want to play with you soooooo badly......<br />Anyway... my human went to re-order and the price has jumped by $3 and the shipping and handling went from $6.49 to $19.01.  Her yelp of horror scared me out of sound sleep.  I was dreaming of open fields and frisky ferrets.  ""Seriously?"" she screeched? ""The total price jumped from $41.62 to $57.50 in two months time?""  She's on a rant.  She's going back to the pet megalomart because she can haul her own bag of food for that price.  Oh, all you fine wee ferrets, get ready, I'm coming to seeeeee yooooouuuuuuu!!"
positive,"Not only is this great on sandwiches and roast beef, this is hands-down the best ready prepared dipping sauce for sweet potato fries!  I have not seen any attempt by Kraft to mass market these specialty mayos and I wish they would.  I would hate to see a great product disappear from the shelves because of a poor marketing strategy."
negative,"I had purchased the product before from local supermarket but have had a hard time locating - was glad to find it on amazon - but when received - all 6 jars show a ""best used by May 2011"" - a 2 month period.  Much shorter than I would have expected for a ""lot"".  Will try and find a local supplier to avoid this problem in the future."
positive,"The beans are large and evenly roasted, with no ""quakers"" --the runty, wizened bits that Cook's Illustrated determined are the cause of that truck-stop coffee flavor. It's organic, and has a nice rich smooth dark taste that isn't burned at all."
negative,"My taste runs to a bold Dark Roast, with lots of flavor- i.e. Cafe Altura Dark Roast Peruvian/Sumatran.<br /><br />This is a bland/tasteless Breakfast type blend, with no distinctive flavor (2 rounded tbs per 6oz)- i.e. Folgers Classic.<br /><br />I like to switch around to different Organic beans (no burn-out), and was hoping to add this to the list?- NOT!<br /><br />Now I'm stuck using these beans up."
positive,"I like dark roasts.  I like a strong cup of coffee - as strong as it can be without tasting burnt or bitter.  I like this better than comparable roasts I have bought from Starbuck's, Tully's and Millstone.  It's really, really good."
negative,"Was not worth buying. Prepared according to directions and ended up in the trash. Batter was extremely thick, the bread did not rise and had no taste to it.  Now I'm stuck with the remaining three which I'll need to figure out how to doctor the recipe in order to have better luck next time.  I can make much better pumpkin bread from scratch using my own recipe."
negative,"If you need a brick that tastes like flour, is heavy enough to keep the car from rolling, and has no taste, color, or smell of pumpkin or spice, buy this mix. It was quite a disappointment. I made two loaves, just in case the first was a fluke and the second was worse than the first."
negative,I tried 2 of 4 in the bread machine and both came out like uncooked dough.  I couldn't find an expiration date on the packages.  Could have been old or just a bad product.
positive,"The package suggests adding nuts, raisins, grated carrots and coconut.  I added only pecans and raisins.  The next time I will try the other suggestions.  The bread is very good, just sweet and spicy enough.  I ordered more."
positive,"The illusion of nutrition... The ingredients aren't all that wholesome (high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup are the first two ingredients), but these Nutrigrain bars are popular in the office.  3 grams of fat and 130 calories in a bar."
negative,"I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8... to get 48 bars, would would be spending $18, instead of $22+ (shipping, tax, etc). Plus, then i can choose the variety of flavors we want, not what is pre-boxed. While some of the bulk items here are a deal, many are not!"
positive,"My son is not a breakfast eater at ALL. He hates to<br />eat anything in the morning. I tried everything<br />and he finally will eat these. It is nice because<br />then he can eat them in the car or on the way to the<br />bus. And if he doesn't finish it, no big deal, like it<br />was when I would get up half an hour early to make him<br />a breakfast sandwich. ;) These are a great price for the<br />amount of bars, and taste wonderful, too!"
positive,"I would not recommend buying this product because of its large quantities and extremely sweet flavor. Caution: They may not be as healthy as they seem.<br /><br />When I first got these cereal bars I honestly thought they were delicious and great. I ate a couple every few days. It's true that this product would make a great snack or quick breakfast... but only for a short period of time. I soon got tired of these cereal bars and half of the box still exists (it was only me eating them).<br /><br />They are very very sweet and there's more of the sweet jam filling than the multigrain wrap. If you do not have much of a sweet tooth (like me) I do not recommend getting these. And if you really want them, buy the individual boxes in stores. They may be a bit more pricey if you count the individual cost, but you get more choices of flavors and there's only 8 bars per box so you wont end up with a ton left over when you finally get sick of them. And plus, leftover food is still money wasted.<br />Amazon has them but they only sell the boxes in 6 count packs like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYFCHW"">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Cherry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E77LT6"">Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Strawberry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a> so you still get 48 bars.<br /><br />So I give this product 3 stars. It's okay, but not great. And they are 120 calories per bar."
positive,I love these soft delicious fruit bars in the morning with my tea--this was more economical to buy in bulk--being a prime member I also had no shipping cost...
positive,"The products came in timely manner, fresh and packaging was in good condition. Which is important to me."
positive,I love these things. And I love getting a big box so that I don't have to spend $1 for each one in the vending machine at work. Good stuff.
positive,"I was happy to find a variety pack of the Nutri Grain bars.  These make a great quick breakfast or mid-afternoon snack when you're in a hurry.  I like the apple cinnamon flavor and the blueberry are pretty good too, but no one seems to be fond of the strawberry ones.  Out of a 48 count box, most of the strawberry ones are still sitting here untouched."
negative,I hope that Kelloggs stops trying to save $.01 cent by using High Fructose instead of sugar and gets out of bed with the US Corn Industry.
negative,"Do not bother buying this product. It is processed food. The definition of unhealthiness, it does not fill you up at all. It makes you feel sick after wards. America does not need to be any fatter than it already is, so please go to the grocery store and buy something healthy for your kids."
positive,Freeze the concentrate in ice cube trays.  Put 4 cubes in a blender with 1 TBS powdered plain yogurt.  Add milk to cover cubes and blend.  OUTSTANDING!!
negative,"I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket."
positive,"I usually use Bariani of California, and that stuff is like GOLD.  You could sip it from a spoon, no kidding.  But there is no way would I ruin the delicate flavor by heating it or cooking with it.  So I tried Zoe Organic EVOO, really not expecting much, hoping it would be ""good enough"" for baking and stir-frying.  I was really pleasantly surprised!  It is stronger than I'm used to, but still mild enough to not overpower things like pie crusts and cookies.  I am back to renew my subscription for this great, all purpose EVOO!"
positive,"As you can see by my name, I am a green, organic mom blogger, and always try to shop accordingly.  I was already a big fan of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2"">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house."
negative,"Amazon just cancelled the 1L 2-pack of this good oil via subscribe & save @ 18.71 for my last shipment. That is 67 oz's of oil. Now it's 51 oz's for 22$ in subscribe & save, that is an increase from 0.28$ per OZ to 0.43$ per oz -- about 30% increase in price. Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years. But it's getting way to pricey for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's not Amazon - maybe it's the supplier price increase -- but it is a sad turn of events.<br /><br />Just read a bunch of articles about how low olive oil prices are hurting europe -- sounds like gouging to me."
positive,"This was a pretty good olive oil.  I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.  First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Conclusion is if you want a thin, light oil then this is a good choice, for a more robust flavor, there are better options."
positive,"I lived in sicily for over a year and I have had the best olive oil known to man.  Once back stateside trying to find something even remotely comparable is near impossible.  Then I found this.....So far it is the best I have been able to find over here.  Light, perfect, great flavor.  I will continue to use this for all my olive oil needs."
positive,"I am getting this regularly via subscribe and save option and I must say this is a pretty good deal given the quality of the product. Although the taste difference in organic vs regular Zoe oils is subtle, I like to believe going organic is good for me. If you know much about or have used olive oils regularly, you'd love the taste of this particular extra virgin olive oil. Apart from being healthy this is full flavored - real extra virgin and not diluted like many store brands- and comes in a can to protect the oil from exposure to direct sun light. Go for it, with free shipping, you can't go wrong."
positive,"I HAVE STARTED TO USE OLIVE OIL FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS, TRIED MANY OTHERS, ZOE IS THE ONLY OLIVE OIL I HAVE FOUND THAT IS MELLOW AND SMOOTH TO ME. FOR THE VALUE YOU CANT FIND BETTER,  JUST GIVE IT A TRY. I HAVE USED OIL FOR ABOUT A YEAR , I USE ABOUT 6 TABLE SPOONS EACH DAY. SKIN IS SMOOTH , HAIR LOOKS BETTER , FEEL BETTER. I AM 83 YRS YOUNG  AND I NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET."
positive,Zoe is an excellent cooking oil and the metal container promotes its integrity for long shelf life.<br />It is also useful for other processes calling for olive oil.
positive,"would have given 5 stars, but the tin spout is poorly designed and the precious oil spills all over the place!"
positive,"It's of high quality, but the usage of the lid needs more instruction for the new customer.<br />I messed it up and it will leaks a little bit every time after use. A small card of instruction on how to open the lid is helpful."
positive,"Love this stuff. I use it for everything from cooking, to salad dressings, to dipping my (gluten-free) bread in. It has a rich texture. I love that it is full-bodies, yet not overpowering. For the price, it is an excellent oil for being organic. I buy it through subscribe and save. I will continue to buy it. Not only is it good flavored, and a good value, but I can easily fit it on my shelf."
negative,"I am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product. I have been buying this for years and have had this on S&S for sometime.  My S&S was recently cancelled by Amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship (hence i ran out of Olive Oil).  I went on to re-order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to Amazon Frustration Free Packaging (yes I should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re-bought)however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were HALF the size than the old ones.  So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again, I'll have to find a new one. Now I am even more upset as I just came on here to write a review and when I search Zoe Olive Oil - the 1 Liter tins came up - but are no longer on S&S <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNAE8"">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and they are 50 cents more than the 25.5 ounce 2 Pack on S&S.  These are basically a rip off now.  I hate to leave a negative product review about something that I like, but this one bothered me so much I felt completed to inform other consumers about the recent changes."
positive,"I have used the Zoe Olive Oil for some time, and cannot or will not do without it..I have even shared with family and friends to get them to use it also..Keep up the great job.."
positive,"We only use olive oil, peanut oil, and grass fed butter for our fats. I have been using Zoe organic olive oil for several years now. When I first started buying it from Amazon the packing was not so great and cans were frequently dented. New packing works wonderful and no more dented cans. Zoe olive oil works wonderful for baking and general purpose needs. It makes great homemade mayo. For the quantity we use the price is right. I use it in salad dressings also and it tastes just fine."
positive,"This is great for cooking and gift giving.  I like that it's in cans, takes less space, and is organic.  Not the best I've had, but for daily use and cooking it's great.<br />I have it on subscribe and save every 4-6 months or so.  I live alone, so they last a long time.  I use olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, for everything . . . I don't use butter or other oils anymore.<br /><br />Great product, well packaged for shipping, since Amazon likes to just toss things in a box without protecting anything.  This company thinks ahead, and the cans are very well protected for shipping.<br /><br />They are much smaller than they seem on the computer,  because of the shape, I guess.  Still a great value, even though they raise the price every order by about $2.00, so I probably will be shopping for another brand by next order.."
positive,"This olive oil has a nice, subtle flavor. No acidic ""bite"" like you may taste from some cheap Italian or Greek olive oils. Great for salads and mixing with herbs for dipping bread. Not a bad price for an organic, either."
positive,"I have read that olives are a heavily pesticided crop, so switched to organic evoo. This Brand, on subscribe and save, is the best priced organic evoo I have found. My one complaint is the spout, which tends to spill. I transfer it into a bottle, to minimize the waste."
positive,I am very pleased with this product. It's taste good. The little sit back is the tin itself. You have to pour the oil in an other bottle or will have a mess every time.
positive,I first purchased this brand of olive oil after tasting it at a wine and cheese shop. It has a great flavor and I paid three times as much for it. It's beautiful tin also makes it a great gift.
positive,The taste is great. I like it. But the cover is not good. It is easy to spread some oil on the top of the cover when open it.
positive,I order this oil via subscribe and save - I chose it because of the convenient size and because it is organic. It has a slightly bitter/sharp flavor that makes it too strong for some applications but I use it for all my salad dressings and cooking and have not looked around for any other for many months.
negative,"I bought this because it was such a good deal, but it went rancid so quickly I will not buy it again."
positive,"I bought this on ""Special"" and am so glad I did.  It has a wonderful strng Olive taste.  Exactly what I was looking for."
positive,"This is my second pack this year. We all love the taste and texture. Mainly we use this oil for salad dressings and cooking in cast iron, which brings out the aroma as well. Great product for the price and quality."
positive,"We have used several olive oils, this one is very nice. I stopped my automatic delivery when the price was automatically increased. Anyone that I have given this to as a gift, also enjoyed it."
positive,"Seriously,  I like this product a lot, and think it better than those recommended in the Cook's Classic Best Recipe series cookbooks:  Davinci; Pompeian, and Colavita!<br /><br />The smaller cans are a bit of a pain, but I do get to lick my (compulsively washed) fingers.<br /><br />My favorite artesanal EVOO is Il Borro from Tuscany - I'll be there for the last 7 nights in March and plan to return with as much as I can carry.  It is very floral/fruity with a hint of rich spicy herbs, and a bit of a bite on the finish - great stuff!<br /><br />Provecho."
positive,I subscribe to this product and really like it.  It has a good flavor and food cooks well in it.
positive,"its olive oil...not much to say<br />trans fats free! high in antioxidants<br />great on pasta, bread, meat,<br />or even just as a dip with some spices<br />the fact that there were 2 made up for the small size<br />it was some real quality olive oil"
positive,"We are very pleased with this product.  I like the packaging, they fit nicely into our pantry vs. the clumsy bottles we used to get at the supermarket.  The oil is flavorful and not bitter, a quality product for sure.  We will buy these from now on."
negative,"I could not belive the size of these tins for the price, so I ventured to measure the quantity since it didn't seem possible that the tins could possible hold 25.5 ounces in oil. Surely, the weight includes the weight of the tins which feels heavy enough to raise suspisions The quality was average and thus overpriced. Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice. I will continue to do what I have been doing in the past and shop around.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />This oil is dangerous for frying in a pan, it splashes as if water was added to make this oil which would explain the lightness in texture. Disapointed that the container does not disclose that this is not pure oil and that water is being added."
positive,"Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil brings out the best in food, whether you cook with it or use it in salads. When I first bought it, my wife complained that it was too expensive. But after a while she said that it was better tasting than any oil she had ever used and insisted that we reorder it.<br /><br />We use olive oil because we are concerned about our cholesterol. Just a little bit of Zoe is all that is needed to cook foods in an Orka steamer for delicious and healthy meals, microwaved in just minutes. We use it almost daily to make wonderful tasting, fish and vegetables that way. Chinese leftovers and rice tastes like it was freshly cooked when you reheat it this way with teaspoon of this oil.<br /><br />We recommend it highly!"
positive,"For the price this olive oil is very good.  We use it all summer on our fresh salads (especially caprese!) and in addition to having a crisp flavor, it is very smooth with a slight sweetness.  Excellent with a good balsamic.  It is wonderful for cooking as well."
positive,I bought the Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil because it was at a great price.  I like the fact that it is organic.  The style of the container does a wonderful job of avoiding spills.
positive,"the quality of oil is great. I give it four stars because of the tin design. It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying."
positive,"This is my over all FAV olive oil!  its just strong enough and pure enough to go into everything without over powering, but at the same time is awesome alone as the ""flavor ingredient"" I never find it bitter or week in anything I cook."
positive,The oil itself is actually pretty good but the tins that I received were 750ml rather than the 1L that was advertised. Caveat Emptor!
positive,We use this Zoe Organic EVOO all the time and it doesn't disappoint. Amazon.com sells it at a great price and I get a few tins each year.
positive,After returning from Italy I wanted to find a better one than I had been using.  This one is it!
negative,"I love this oil, good flavor, love that it's organic, BUT the pour spout makes such a mess on the top of the tin that you have to wipe up & waste (1/2 teaspoon with every single pour) and sometimes even runs down the side of the tin that I won't be buying it again unless the tin is designed better.  I've tried pouring fast, slow, etc. and it just doesn't pour well at all."
negative,"I miss read before I ordered, got 2 very small tins of oil.  Later realized that there is a 2 LITER pack for nearly the same price.  So I'm going to say this particular version of the product is overpriced.  Especially for a tin can, I have used this packaging for olive oil before and you tend to lose that last serving or so in the lip of the tin.  Drives me crazy!  For this reason, I'm 2 starring it, and am going to make sure to check my ounces before I send in a future order."
negative,I bought this olive oil because I thought it was a good deal for a large quantity of olive oil and it wasn't nearly as much as I thought it would be.
negative,"My dog did well with this food for about a year, but the latest bag we purchased caused recurring bouts of profusely bloody diarrhea, resulting in an expensive trip to the emergency vet. I later found that there has been a recall of this pet food for possible salmonella contamination. We've switched to another brand, and she's doing great. I think I'll avoid this one in the future."
positive,We have used Chicken Soup Dog food for years. It has the right ingredients and is reasonably priced. We have fed our German Short hair the senior food and our Jack Russell on the adult. Both seem to agree with the dogs.
negative,This food worked great for my two dogs up until about a year ago. Something changed in this food which caused both dogs severe diarrhea. Trialing them off and then on this food again caused the problems to return. We switched to a different brand.
negative,I have two dogs that eat this food.  Both got very sick off of it.  The company offers a coupon or a refund for the bag of food.  What about the $500 worth of vet bills I had to pay because my dogs ate this food????  I will never ever buy this brand again and would not recommend it.
positive,"Needed Kcups for my daugher at collge.  Thought it was a coffee/tea variety pack, but she didn't mind since she loves tea as well.  Service was quick."
positive,The tea flavor was just as I remembered  at home in the UK. Strong full flavor.
positive,This was the perfect product for the application I needed. I need to make white chocolate or candy melts taste more like cream cheese frosting. This did the trick! I am excited to use it in other recipes.
positive,I just love this tea.  It's the only tea I drink.  It has that nice smooth flavor--not like black tea.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
positive,This is GREAT TEA!  I would highly recommend this tea.  The flavor is great hot or cold.  I wish it were organic :O)
positive,"Bentley's Ginger Peach White Tea, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)<br /><br />What can I say?  Since we discovered this tea some two years ago, it is the only tea that we use.  Bentley is known for it's high quality and this white tea is just that.  The light hint of ginger with the pleasant blending of peach makes this a very smooth delight.  While it is not caffeine free it certainly is lower in caffeine than other green or black teas therefore also making it a fine evening dinner tea.  TO YOUR HEALTH!"
positive,"I have to say this is one of my most favorite flavors of white tea so far next to blueberry white tea. Also, Bentley's is the highest quality and best tasting brand for Ceylon white tea that I've tried so far. I highly recommend this brand and flavor of tea."
positive,"Came quickly.  Boxes were in good shape for gift giving.  Taste of tea is acquired.  A little bit medicinal, but gets better after a few cups!"
negative,I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee.  Fortunately I didn't pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler.  Yuck!  It doesn't taste like good coffee and it doesn't taste like French Vanilla.  Point blank I couldn't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I don't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it's all a matter of individual preference.
negative,"I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible.  Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE!  And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.<br /><br />I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money."
positive,"A sample of these Van Houtte ""French Vanilla K-Cups"" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a ""hit-or-miss"" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the ""Large Cup"" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH"
positive,Love this coffee!!!  Will buy over and over again.  You can't beat Amazon's price with free shipping!
negative,"I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others."
negative,"I love French vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this. It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.<br /><br />In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product. I actually like light roasts but this is the first time I've had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was."
negative,"Lurid...weak, chemical tasting all describes this K-Cup. French Vanilla is not the best flavor but Van Houttes makes it seem like the worst. If you like weak, chem-tasting coffee then you will love this!"
negative,Not as impressed with brand of coffee.  It was very weak with the flavor. I would recommend the Green Mountain French Vanilla.
positive,Coffee is OK.  There are better French Vanilla coffee companies (this is weak flavored)<br />3 stars as only 18 cups (NOT 24 cups per box)
positive,"The French Vanilla is wonderful.  This is our first time and it is wonderful.  My wife loves flavored coffees, so, this was just a natural way to go.<br />We both enjoy a coffee in the morning and one when entertaining some evenings.<br />These k-cups are perfect for entertaining and fast perks. Enjoy!!!"
positive,"Personally, I prefer the decaffeinated brands by this manufacturer but it was good for the price!"
negative,"I received two of these in a sampler package I had ordered through Keurig.com I made one cup, added my Coffeemate and Splenda...and...EWW! It was so bad I poured the rest down the sink and threw away the other K-Cup. I will not be ordering this variety EVER."
positive,"The item I purchased was delivered in a timely manner and was available at a good price.  The shipping cost seemed a bit high, but the product was fresh and received in good condition."
positive,Good wing sauce had a bbq and everyone one ate the drum sticks right up. Best of all the sauce says its Medium and tastes even milder to me. More of a buttery flavor base. I get heart burn really bad and am not a big fan of super spicy sauces. So this was right up my alley and made everyone happy. Try it out good quality product.
positive,"This is a great tea and the Ultra Chai is my favorite flavor!  I have a cup every morning and take it on trips--I am never without it.  The tea is incidental to my weight loss, I am sure, but just for full disclosure, I adopted a low-fat plant-based diet at the same time I started drinking this daily and I have lost 100 pounds.  I just love the flavor and love this tea!"
positive,This is a great tasting tea.  I use one bag for my 16oz commuter cup each morning.  I started ordering it online when the supermarket price went up rapidly and now...the cost has doubled since the first time I ordered it in 2009. I am assessing whether it is that good.
positive,I just LOVE the BONKERS SUPER SKINNY CHAI TEA. It tastes so good. I have been drinking it for about a year now. I have not seen a big weight loss but have stayed the same weight. I don't know if tit really works I just love how good it tastes
positive,"My son used to only eat the Penne by Bi-Aglut, but once they stopped importing it, we were screwed.  We tried numerous brands and he didn't like any of them until we switched to Orgran.  We buy a box about every month or so.  I only wish they allowed you to put this on the subscribe program so we could get a break on the price."
negative,"My cat normally loves and reacts strongly to catnip.  I've used a spray catnip before and he rolled and played.  However, when I spray this on his toys or his rug there is no reaction at alll.  I finally threw the bottle away."
positive,This stuff was pretty good.  I like the flavor and it came fairly quickly.  Gum was very fresh.
negative,I like the original flavored Big league chew gum and decided to buy this but this flavor is just gross.  I still have 8 packs left after giving away a few to my friends who did not enjoy it either.  Amazon did great on their part but this gum is just disgusting... stay away and don't buy this!
positive,This cooks and tastes like regular wheat pasta.  It is a bit firmer so no worries about ending up with mushy pasta.  The kids didn't even notice it was Quinoa.  They eat it with just a bit of butter and pepper.  So far we have used it with marinara but I am sure it will work great with lighter sauces.
negative,Compared to other sugar free candies this candy has little taste of the fruit or of the sweet.<br />It is not worth the value.
positive,The zylitol hard candies are delicious and have a nice variety of flavors. They were recommended to me by my dentist to help promote saliva production in my dry mouth which will help prevent cavities. I would recommend this product and the amazon web site to others.
positive,"Use all flavors to flavor food without calories and sugar.  Tastes great, but you MUST be careful on pricing.  I only paid $2.99 per bottle and at the time of writing this, the price is now $6.95.  Consumer beware!"
positive,I bought this to flavor margaritas.  I didn't need much of the flavoring to have the effect (taste) that I wanted.
positive,"This flavoring smells amazing; I bought it to make homemade Bubblegum Ice Cream just like I used to get from Dipper Dan's Ice Cream Parlor when I was a child.  Ordered this but didn't get to make any icecream during the holidays.  Hope to make some soon.  It smells just like bubblegum & I am sure it tastes like bubblegum in recipes.  Thank you so much.  Sincerely, RL"
positive,"I am very sensitive to MSG and all its derivatives (yeast extract, etc).  This is the only Cream of Mushroom soup I have ever found that does not have yeast extract in it or MSG.  Even other ""organic"" cream of mushroom soups contain yeast extract.  I had to give up some of my favorite recipes because I couldn't find a cream of mushroom soup that didn't cause me to have my ""MSG headaches.""  Well not any more.  I can enjoy all my favorite recipes again!  This soup is great tasting and adds wonderful flavor to my recipes.  I even love how it comes in a carton rather than a can.  The quality of the soup is great and the ingredients are all natrual.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has MSG sensitivities or who is just looking to add more great tasting natural ingredients to their recipes."
negative,"If you're looking for a Campbell's cream of mushroom soup substitute, this isn't it. It doesn't have the milky-creamy consistency of Campbell's. It has a sour taste, from the cultured cream and whey. The broth is transparent. The pieces of mushroom are bigger. It's really nothing like Campbell's in taste or appearance. It's definitely much, much healthier, but I don't like the taste or texture and won't be buying it again. I'll be making my own cream of mushroom soup from now on."
positive,Not bad.  On a low carb diet and it had more carbs than I thought it would.  18 per serving.  I will probably switch back to Campbells.
negative,"I love garlic; in tomato sauce, on braised dishes and elsewhere.  I can handle garlic when I expect it.  I didn't expect it here.  At least not in this strength.  I guess I'll have to go back to the red & white cans.<br />Hey!  You may like it.  Not for me.<br />I used one and threw the rest out."
negative,"I love Pacific Natural Foods organic soups, especially the creamy tomatoes and butternut squash. But this cream of mushroom soup has no flavor at all. I went with the 12-pack based on my confidence in the brand. Now I am stuck with 11 packs of bad soups."
positive,My two great danes eat this. It is high quality food and they seem to love the taste. We had a problem with very loose stools and this food has helped immensely. Check around for prices. Sometimes it is cheaper on line and sometimes in your local feed store.
positive,I bought this due to my dog seeming to have a food allergy to corn and grains. He eats it and seems to enjoy it so time will tell if this solves his skin problems.
positive,"My family has been eating the milk chocolate duncan hines brownies for a couple of years now and absolutely love the them!  Duncan hines brownie & cake mixes are the best.  But, I can buy the brownie mixes at my local Wal Mart or sometimes Target for less than I purchased on Amazon."
positive,"White tea generally has a delicate flavor, but this tea has a more distinct ""straw"" flavor that you might like--or not.  I notice that this particular brand is higher in caffeine than the white teas from Republic of Teas.  The latter has a more subtle flavor as well."
positive,"My dog (A silken windhound) loves any and all rawhide, any and all bones to be truthful. But she injured a tooth once cracking through a beef knuckle bone, and I have since stopped providing her with hard bones. My dog has no interest at all in toys, unless there is a treat in it, then she pulls out the treat in 5 minutes and ignores the toy from then on. So I sought out rawhides as something to engage her off and on during the day. Though she'll chew eagerly on any rawhide I give her, I worry about her choking or gagging on a large hunk of it stuck in her throat, or a large piece getting stuck in her gut. This piggy twist, because it has such tight skinny strands, does not have that risk. On top of that,she'll take nearly two weeks of picking at it to finally finish it off, in spite of her persistance. I am so glad that she can have the rawhide she enjoys, that it doesn't get devoured in a day, and which allows me to feel safe giving it to her. I do wish I could get the 9 inch in a 3-5 pack."
positive,"This is my dogs favorite bone.  She is a Shiba Inu/Labrador mix and loves these bones.  All the dogs that come over all love this bone too!  Even though it's 9"" any sized dog can chew on it because of the individual strands."
positive,"These were really quite hard for my teeth!  I was hoping they were the texture of the fruit snacks which are also real fruit, but super soft and chewy, but not sticking to my teeth.  These were chewy alright, but hard--think old licorice or JuJuBees that have sat out for a week.  Were they tasty?  Ok, but I couldn't really tell one flavor from another.  Did I eat them when I was sitting at work and wanted chips or chocolate?  Yes, they gave me something to chew.  And chew.  And chew.  My kids ate them too, but they eat anything and are not very picky at all.  I thought it was misleading when I saw the top three ingredients were corn syrup, sugar, and high fructose corn syrup.  Then fruit purees and finally caranauba wax.  Will not buy again."
positive,These Gummies are tasty.  No complaints from the kids.  Less guilt giving them real food sweets than the synthetic alternatives with all their preservatives and artifical ingredients.
positive,"I have a similar product that I purchased at Wal-Mart for less than $5 for 19.25 oz., so this price is way too high.  The product currently comes with 20% free, so it probably is usually available in a 16 oz. size.  The product that I purchased is called Ann's House ""Good Health Energy"", but it appears to be a similar mix of soynuts, cranberries, almonds and pumpkin kernels.  A 1/4 serving provides 8 grams of fat, 6 grams of sugar, 3 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein.  There are other mixes available including Macadamia Perfection, Cranberry Nut Antioxidant, Chocolate Nut Antioxidant, Creamy Strawberry Almond and Pistachio Perfection.  I did not see all of these at the store.  The product is very high quality and Ann's House has been in business since 1973."
positive,"I use to purchase this product at Costco for half the price,although I really like the product it's too expensive.."
positive,This product is addictive. Sprinkle it on your oatmeal or just eat it from the container. The soy nuts are a bit dry but delicious none the less. Glad that I found it on Amazon.
positive,This is a great snack anytime of the day. I tastes good and is good for you. No sodium or cholesterol and all natural. It is also a great pick me up for the late afternoon.
positive,This snack is highly nutritious and great tasting.  Amazon's price is far too high.  I buy the identical product at Costco for $7.79.
positive,"We enjoy Ann's House Soy Energy Blend.  We started buying it at Costco, but they stopped selling it and started selling Ann's House Edamame.  We like the Soy Energy Blend so much better.  It is good and apparently healthy for you."
positive,"For a fatty like myself it's hard to keep from gobbling up a bunch of garbage... This stuff keeps me relatively satiated for several hours with a single serving...<br /><br />Costco has the same container, same brand, same product for 9 bucks."
positive,I love this mix! $19.99 seemed high and I checked our Costco receipt. $7.69 for the same 36 ounce size. Enough said.
negative,"Received this in a gift basket, it tastes good but.....and it is a BIG BUT.....look on the ingredients listed and the pumpkin seeds in the mix are imported from China.??  I apologize and hope I don't offend but I refuse to give my children untested food imported from China given the current manufacturing problems they have had over there with toxins and chemicals placed in food products (I.E.  baby formula)  These must be extremely cheap pumpkin seeds to warrant this which makes me nervous, why else import them from China and not use USA pumkin seeds?  Sorry, will take a closer look at all ingredients from ""Anna""s House"" in the future."
negative,"I fell in LOVE with this product while visiting my Son in Honolulu, he purchases this at Cosco. As soon as I arrived back to the midwest I called EVERY Costco and requested and researched as to why this Cost's SO much on line and is unavailable in the Midwest or any Markets.<br /><br />It would apear this product is NOT safe under the USDA guidelines and this to be the reason for a HUGE cost Increase on line and the reason it is Unavailable in the stores normally found in.<br /><br />WHAT a SHAME ! ! ! I found a greater Energy prior to my daily Yoga and after my daily hygiene regimine for the day while eating this Mix. I would think this company; ""Anne's House"" would find a substitute to replace the requests for thier product. If this product is not safe under the guidelines of the FDA it should have been found before ever allowed to be placed on the shelves in the USA.<br /><br />I WISH I could find A Substiture Product as good Anne's House Soy Energy Blend that is Safe and is Reasonably priced on the shelves in the USA once again."
negative,The bulk of this product is soy nuts which is pretty much inedible. I tried a few and they are tasteless and bland. I put some out for the squirrels and birds. They ate the almonds and cranberries but left the soy nuts. Even my dog won't eat them and he eats horse manure! Out of the 36oz in the package there's probably 25oz of soynuts that I can't even give away. Waste of money.
positive,"This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is really great tasting, too."
positive,"Add to water, stir and voila! Delicious slightly tart cherry drink for those times when you want to be refreshed, but also want a bit of flavor to your water."
positive,"Jeremiah's Kona Blend is a good tasting, middle of the road coffee bean.  While not as flavorful as J's Fogbuster, the Kona is light and mellow, offering a nice change of pace for dark roast drinkers.  I brew in a french press most mornings, but when I ran it through a drip machine for company the flavor became too slight.  Be prepared to grind a lot of beans if you brew drip.  Overall a good pick and a good value."
positive,"This Kona blend has smooth flavor and good taste for the price.  I would definately consider buying this again as 100% Kona coffee is very expensive, so this makes for a nice compromise.  As long as you know that when you are purchasing this product that it is a blend, it is my belief that you won't be dissapointed."
negative,I found Jeremiah's Pick Kona Blend lacking flavor. I tried every trick I know to bring out all the taste it had but still found it weak.
positive,"Great coffee from a familiar maker, this kona blend really rocks and the price is unbeatable anywhere!"
positive,"We really liked Jeremiah's Pick Fogbusters coffee in the five pound whole bean package, so I ordered this one for a bit of variety.  We're SO pleased!<br /><br />Yes, it's a blend (what did you expect for the price?), but the mellow smoothness of the Kona really comes through and makes for an outstanding pot of coffee.  Without the almost-bitter notes of the Fogbuster, this Kona blend is complex, rich and delicious.<br /><br />For a 12 cup drip coffeemaker, I use two and a quarter coffee scoops of the beans and grind for 15 seconds.  It's perfect, and way better than Maxwell House or Folgers.  Highly recommended!"
positive,It was a nice product with a value price what can I say but great job and thank you
positive,"Very happy with product. Roast is just like I like it, not too light, not too dark. Makes a nice cup of coffee with just enough of the Kona to make it enjoyable."
positive,"The true test of a coffee's flavor for me is to drink it as espresso.  I've been roasting my own coffee for years, but mix it up sometimes by buying already roasted coffee.  This coffee has a great flavor with no bitter after taste when I drink a shot from my espresso machine.  When I drink it as regular coffee, I'll blend several of my favorite beans to get more complex flavors.  If you really want to find your favorite coffee, do a blind taste test.  It's fun and you might be surprised at which coffee you choose when your preconceived notions are taken out of the equation."
positive,"It is a great coffee, my husband and I bought 18 different coffee's made cappuccino, espresso and latte. This coffee is great for everything, no after taste or bitter residue."
negative,"This coffee is NOT what I expected! I have had Kona coffee before which was spectacular! I guess that is what I was looking for. But you will not find it here. This is a blend, and that is probably why. I will never buy this again!"
negative,"We usually drink french roast coffee (San Francisco Bay) that we grind daily and we've been enjoying that kind of coffee for a while.  We were visiting friends and we were served coffee which tasted very good and it was a bit milder than what we drink, so I asked about the brand and was told it was Jermiah's Kona mixed with some french roast.  I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged.  As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry.  I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee.  I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success.  I don't know if I got a stale bag or what, but my experience left me with a bad taste. Amazon was great and they offered a refund.  Thank you Amazon!"
positive,"We were given a pound of kona as a gift and loved it so i was tasked with finding a coffee for everday use thaT tasted close. Well after looking at the cost per pound of what we were using, starbucks breakfest blend at 12.00 per lb and then buying this at around 8.00 per lb it was a no brainer. I don't know I didn't do this years ago.<br />I honestly can not tell the difference between the 100% kona and this blend and its priced at a little more than folgers?<br />I hate to put this reveiw out there for fear that the price of this and availablity will be affected.<br />SO HERE IT IS FOLKS. AS CLOSE TO 100% KONA AS YOU CAN GET AND CHEAPER THAN MOST A++++."
positive,"Been drinkin gormet coffee many years now, bunch of different brands and roasters. It's hard to beat the Coffee Fool for quality and freshness, but I've come back to this Jerimias' pick for the quality and the savings I get here at Amazon. Its a great value and superb freshness--you'll be very pleased!"
positive,Good product for the price.  It could be a little smoother which is what Kona is noted for.  Would like to know just how much Kona is in the 'blend'.  I don't think it is as much as when you buy it on amazon in one pound packages. Overall I'm still happy to have 5 pounds on hand.
negative,"I like my coffee black, but found this pretty much undrinkable without milk, and my office mates agreed.  It really does just taste charred.  I'm not sure if it's all like this or I just got a bad batch.  Anyways, the price isn't bad, but I can't recommend this to anyone.  I'm still looking for a good, reasonably priced 5lb bag."
positive,"This has been our new go-to coffee.  It's got a balanced taste and smells great.  Good price for the bag, too.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish they offered it as an Organic option."
positive,"This is great coffee.  I make 8 cups every day and we use extra when we have company.  I have a bag sent to me every month.  It is the best coffee.  I have had many compliments on it. I got a rubbermaid container that has a handle and pours and it holds the whole thing.  I grind the beans every night when I set up my machine and it is very fresh.  We like strong, but not bitter coffee and we drink it black no sugar.  This is rich full bodied but never bitter or acidic tasting.  I have been using it for over a year and I will continue to use it until they no longer sell it.  My in-laws like it so much I am planning to get them a subscription for Christmas.  We used to use Gevalia, but this is far superior and less than half the price. When I first ordered it I was afraid we would not like it because it was so cheap.  It is the cheapest stuff I have ever bought.  I only bought it because a reviewer that was reviewing a different coffee I planned to get recommended this instead."
positive,"I purchased this coffee because I tend to like Kona blends, but this is far from the best of the bunch.  I rate it average because that's how it tastes. Nothing there to make me want to purchase it again when I have tasted other brands that were better. Unfortunately a five pound bag will last a long time."
negative,"These beans are so dry they crumble.  Horrible coffee.  Reminds me of the starbuck's beans you get at Walmart.  Yuck.  Avoid at all costs, they are not what they appear."
negative,"A lot of reviews say this coffee is smooth, my wife and I disagree.  We think it is very bitter.  We will not order these beans again but are open to trying other Jeremiah's products..."
positive,"Long wait! I suppose it's my fault for ordering from the webstore as I am in CA and I think this comes from the east coast so it took forever to get here. My dog and I are loving this food so far. TMI but seriously, her poos are so small and barely smell. She liked it dry, which is kind of funny, but I do wet it sometimes. The feeding guidelines are a little ambiguous, so I plan to call Addiction directly. As for the store (Whole Health Pet, I believe), they are great! As I mentioned the wait was long, but I ordered from them twice and both times received a couple of samples and goodies for my dog; a sample packet of another grain-free Addiction flavor and a freeze dried meat treat - great attention to detail!"
positive,This was a bit strong from what I am used to but after drinking it a few times the flavor was great. I was pleased.
positive,What can I say My cat loves them so I assume they are pretty tasty.<br /><br />I can't say for sure because I have really not tried them myself :)
positive,"A small bag that was overpriced. The candy tasted fine and served its nostalgia purpose, but it would not be ordered again."
positive,"I purchased this puppy food for my friend who has an elderly, toothless poodle named Prissy. My friend was hand-feeding her, desperately trying just to get her to eat. Now with this food Prissy has an eager appetite on her own and also has gained some much needed weight. My friend considers this food to be a life-saver for her old girl."
negative,"I had a German Shepherd puppy who had frequent diarrhea. Giardia and fecal tests at the Vet's always come up negative. I noticed that she had diarrhea whenever I fed her canned food. Since HS is a good brand and there are no recalls, I didn't think it would be the food. I recently adopted another puppy. She did not have diarrhea when I fed her HS Large breed puppy dry food. However, after I gave her some of the canned puppy food, she had bad diarrhea and started vomiting. I'm certain now that this canned food caused diarrhea in both my puppies."
negative,"The advertisement for this product is very misleading and accualy lies out right about what you are getting, it says you are getting 30 8oz packets of  mix when you are accualy getting 30- .5oz oz packets and because of the high price of $17 you are easily misled. The same amount of product at Walmart is approx. $5, around 30% of what this seller sold his for. RIP OFF!!!"
negative,"Though my cat is a huge a fan of all of the Dental Chews produced by greenies, my experience with this product was less than pleasant.<br />This product did the opposite of what it set out to do.  My cat violently vomited hairballs the same evening I fed him these.  In fact, he couldn't digest them at all and has never thrown up so much at one time.  This was unusual and still has me shocked, especially for an animal that regurgitates seldom and mildly.  Be careful, as I wish I had."
positive,"We have tried other greenies treats and other brands. Usually one cat likes one flavor/style and the other doesn't. Both of my adopted cats love these treats. If it were up to them they would eat these treats all day, every day!"
positive,"My cat loves these. She is very small even though she is fully grown so the regular greenies just seemed uncomfortable for her to eat. I tried these and she LOVES THEM, even more than Temptation treats. I've never had problems with vomiting after these."
positive,"My husband stumbled across the old version of these (2009?), and I adored them. Perfect, melt-in-your mouth peppermint stick. NOthing better. And then they changed the formula. He's gotten them for me the last two Christmas. And every year, I dare to hope they've gone back to the earlier formula, but alas, I've been sorely disappointed the last two years. They currently are not melt-in-your mouth, more of a suck and crunch, and then kinda gooey. I'll probably get them again, optimist that I am, in hopes they change the formula back to the grandeur it was."
positive,This makes the best jello salad / dessert and I cannot find apricot jello in the stores in town.  Make jello as directed with 1 cup orange juice (heat to boiling).  Stir in 1 cup buttermilk and a box of apricot jello.  Store in the refrigerator.  This is divine.  The recipe easily doubles and triples.  Hope you enjoy.
positive,This is one of the best flavors that Jell-O makes.  I too could not find it locally except at one store (Brookshires in Texas).  Then I found it here at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to order it immediately.
positive,"We live just northwest of Houston. When I asked about getting this flavor of Jell-O at our local stores(even Wal-Mart!), I was told that even if they could get this flavor, it would be a long process.<br />I got on the internet and had the Jell-O delivered within a week.<br />For my needs, the availability of the product was my most important situation. The product itself was excellent and gave my salad the flavor that I was after.<br /><br />Thank you very much,<br /><br />Linda Mitchell"
positive,Unable to purchase this flavor in the local stores so had to order on-line. Price was reasonable & free shipping made the litle woman happy!!
positive,I use this product to make an apricot bunt cake w/lemon drizzle.......my Mom concocted years ago.  My family loves it......use the apricot jello a lot and thrilled I was able to order it thru Amazon.......very hard to find!
positive,"My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like ""people food"" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well....."
positive,"I received an extremely fresh product, the marshallow inside is so soft you can easily tell the freshnes of it. This chocolate bar along with kit kat are my ultimate american favorites..."
positive,"Slightly upset that the candy box was open but not the candies weren't. Just the candy box. This is a gift to my father and it is his favorite candy in the world. I do hope that he loves this candy that I'm sending him, cause he has to travel for over 1 1/2 hour drive to buy Rocky Roads. See how he loves them. Well Happy Holidays."
positive,"Product came in a timely manner. However, the product itself was less than fresh. When Rocky Road candy is at it's freshest it will literally melt in your mouth. These were a little chewier.  Kind of disappointing"
negative,"I like some of the other flavors of Extra Fruit Sensations gum, but this watermelon flavor gum just tastes flat. Flavor only lasts a couple of minutes; much less than the other flavors."
positive,"I like the watermelon flavor of this gum, and they're not lying when they say the flavor lasts longer. The extra fruit sensations gum is the longest lasting gum I've found. The only negative I have for this gum is one piece really isn't enough for me, I chew two at once."
negative,"I love Go series and know it is good products.<br />My cat used to eat dry food, but she denied to eat can.<br />I trusted the brand and ordered 24.. so I just waste my money.<br />I'll never buy this can again.<br />I gave it to my friend's cats but they didn't like it either.<br />I wonder any cats like this cat??....<br />Honestly, couldn't trust reviews on this web...."
positive,"It was WONDERFUL!boy did it go fast!<br /><br />I went to my 7-11 and gave them one of these lifesavers--so they could decide if they wanted to carry it or not.<br />they had the peppermint and 5 flavor--we really don't care for the lime green and lemon yellow flavors<br />and the ""mints"" are too peppery...<br />But Butterrum is perfect!<br />Turns out, my local liquor store had it.<br />I bought what they had left and asked them to order more.<br /><br />If i want to break my diet, it is better with butterrum--instead of burgers and tacos<br />If you have a bad taste in your mouth from medicine --butterrum<br />if you just want a ""lift"" --Butter Rum!<br /><br />It will be easier to just buy a few rolls locally when we run low<br />and thank you for having it available thru Amazon.<br /><br />We will wait if we have to--but we prefer not to :)"
positive,I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!
positive,Very vast delivery of Teddy Grahams Snacks. If you haven't tried them I suggest that you try them and you will be hooked on them as I am.<br />I take a bag to work to share with coworkers. Just GREAT.
positive,"These cookies are great for kids snacks and for adults. But be careful, cus a little can get out of hand! I ate half of box while snacking and watching tv one night. Plus on auto ship, they are a great bargain."
positive,"Teddy Grahams are soooo delish, they are what a chocolate graham should be. The ones I received were expired, but Amazon worked with me to find a resolution. This issue would not prevent me from ordering them again; Amazon is one of the friendliest, most customer oriented and easiest online or brick and mortar retailers period."
positive,I get these on the subscribe and save program. My kids and I love these crackers.  They are great to have on hand and you can't beat the price. I am paying $7.62 for 2 12 count boxes right now.  I can't even get that price at the store when they are on sale.  Great deal!
positive,Great way to top off a meal with controlled amount and not a lot of sugar. One can never get to old for this kind of treat.
positive,They are definitely Teddy Grahms.  In much better shape than what I could buy at the store.  Not many broken crackers.
positive,I got them all none broken! I wish that the boxes were alittle bit bigger other than that everything was wonderful. I hope my Marine in Okinawa loves them!!!
positive,This is a great snack for my 2.5 year old son.  Easy to carry with us and he loves them.  Got them for a great price which makes them even better!
positive,I love these packs. They are delicious and easy to throw in a diaper bag or my kids lunch in the morning. I can feel better sending them with this instead of cookies and junk.
positive,"My kids love these snacks and I loved the variety! When buying in bulk, it's nice when there are different flavors in the same package ... no boredom here!"
positive,I used these rocks to make a stone fireplace on a cake and they worked great.<br />Quick delivery and they were very fresh and shipped well.
positive,I ordered these for part of the decoration on my beach themed wedding cake and they were great they really looked like rocks and the taste was amazing. I will buy this product again.
negative,They were quiet a bit smaller than I thought and I also  was hoping for bigger more smoother river rock looking as the advertisment 'implied'.
positive,"I like some flavored coffees and teas but must watch my caffiene intake. I have to infuse myself (inserting needles in 4 sites) once a week. I first was introduced to the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte at my hair stylist's. I have a Keurig and never realized this was a tea and that Keurig also carried them until I was on its website. I find they are often out of stock. I found these a bit cheaper here at Amazon and stocked up. Now when I get my hair done once/month and on the morning before I infuse, this is my little indulgence. The flavors and aroma are so calming and relaxing. I even insisted that my sister-in-law who gifted us with a Keurig coffee maker two years ago, try this. I know she likes certain teas and her coffee black. She could not believe it was tea. I sent her home with a box. The only reason I don't drink it more often is due to the empty calories/sugar. I probably should take a star off for that. I am one who does not like a really strong tea or bold coffee so this really pleases my palate. The Cafe Escapes Chai Latte is hands down my favorite."
positive,I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte. I make two cups of it. I found that mixing it on the middle setting and one on the smallest cup setting mixed together makes it a perfect combination! It tastes just like when I used to buy it for 3x the price. It is creamy and the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice kick of flavor in the morning but ins't looking for the caffeine of coffee! I also enjoy this as a little treat since I am watching my weight and this doesn't make a big dent into the amount of calories I consume a day. I did wish I could find i for less expensive on Amazon as my local store has it for a better price but it is not always in stock.
positive,"I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker, but have always been a fan of chai tea. I am used to drinking Panera Bread's version, which is very good. However, chai tea is a spiced milk-based tea to me and most Americans. My Keurig adds water to its drinks so I was ready to be disappointed with this chai tea.<br /><br />As it brews and after taking a smell from the cup, you are hit with warm spices pretty hard. Cinnamon and ginger are ones that I made out but I knew right away it was going to be good.<br /><br />Taking a sip, it is obvious that this isn't a normal K-cup. Further analysis of the nutritional facts reveals that Cafe Escapes uses a creamer based formula and the result is a silky smooth chai tea latte. This is easily my favorite flavor for my Keurig coffee maker. I drink this one later in the day and it just makes you feel great. One of the best chai teas I have ever tried and WAY better than trying to brew it yourself and WAY cheaper than buying it from a cafe.<br /><br />If you don't know about Cafe Escapes and are maybe unsure of their quality, give this a shot, you will thank me (and them). They are known to use a milk-based formula in their K-cups and only make 4 flavors (Chai Tea, 2 different Hot chocolates, and a cafe mocha). I have personally tried all of their flavors and all are very good. However, the chai tea is the only one that I was absolutely blown away by. Two important notes about their brews is 1) their caffeine content is low at less than 10mg per cup (normal cup of coffee is around 100mg) and 2) they don't require you to add creamer or sugar as I am used to with other coffees.<br /><br />I felt that this review was best suited for the 96 count because if you have ever enjoyed chai tea and own a keurig coffee maker, you will be purchasing the 96-count of these at some point!"
positive,I purchased these online because my grandmother loves them and has not been able to find a steady supply near home. She makes one cup every morning and is very happy.
positive,"I was so happy to be able to find this great tasting Chai Latte.  It was out of stock on other sites for a very long time.  If you like Chai Latte, You have to try this one."
positive,"This is the best non-coffee beverage I have found for the Kuerig.  Not as good as my coffee shop Chai Latte, but a great substitute for the mornings when I don't want to leave the house."
negative,"I love coffee. I love chai lattes. I love my Keurig. But this combination was disgusting. The taste when first prepared was STRONG. OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product. This is not listed as lo-cal or diet.. so it was not at all what I was expecting. I would rather have an aspirin dissolve in my mouth. I am returning this to the store. Absolutely terrible."
negative,"This company is gouging you people!!  The product itself is fabulous, the best Chai Latte ever!  But I just bought 6 16-count boxes (what this actually is) from Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10.99 each.  Unfortunately it looks like they've stopped making this so the mark up is just going to get worse.  Shame on you."
positive,what would I do without decaf pods for late night espressos and cappuccinos!!  Need the decaf.  These pods are great and very affordable.
positive,"We had the opportunity to visit this olive oil producer while we were visiting France two years ago. These people were wonderful.....they took us on a private tour of this small but awesome facility. We tasted various olive oils and they were all great !! If you want the best, buy Castelas Olive Oil."
positive,"I am not an expert on pan forte, have never been to Italy and have only had what I could buy in the states. That said, this was wonderful and I will buy it again."
positive,"The flavor is wonderful and rich. I have a Senseo, so sometimes it works better to put one pod in the two pod receiver, then press the one cup water despenser. These pods seem to be a little thicker. However, a little thicker probably means more coffee."
positive,"I have fallen in love with this coffee, and it does seem gentle on the stomach. I was looking for a light roast coffee, when I found this medium roast, and to my surprise it isn't overpowering at all.<br /><br />I don't understand the negative review posted because, it is NOT acidic or bitter at all, maybe they reviewed the wrong product, because this one is super smooth.<br /><br />This coffee is hard to find, I have found 3 places that carry small canisters, but Amazon is the only place I have found the 34.5 Oz.  My recommendation is to buy this without hesitation."
positive,"I'm not what you would call a snob when it comes to coffee. If it's fresh, hot, and not made overly strong, I'm usually quite happy. This coffee tastes the way coffee tastes when you use old grounds. It tastes like the coffee left in the cabinets in your camper. I can drink it and will since my budget doesn't allow me the privilege of not doing so, but I'm pretty crabby about it and will not buy this coffee again."
negative,"I was so disappointed in this coffee.  It seemed to leave a bitter aftertaste that lasted all day..... i tried various ways to make it taste better, and brewed it in a brand new coffee maker, but nothing changed that after taste.... The Folgers Breakfast Blend is MUCH better, and more smooth tasting."
negative,Not even a hint of watermelon. Tastes like sparkling water mixed with cranberry juice cocktail. Not worth the 50 calories and 14 grams of sugar.
positive,"I purchased this mustard from Amazon a few weeks ago.  I don't think I have ever eaten a better mustard than this.  It took me a long time to get used to eating Dijon Mustard.(sorta strong at first) So I gave up on it until I saw this one for sale on Amazon.  I never in my born days thought I would ever find a milder yet richer tasting Dijon mustard like this.  It is the best I have ever eaten and I suggest this to anyone.  I made a vinegrette with this mustard right after I got it and it was soooo delish that my whole family wants my mustard.  Of course, I tell them where to find it.  I will be ordering more!!  Just wish it came in a larger amount."
negative,"I can't give this product a higher review unless I know when the packets expire. When I ordered it, I thought there would be an expiration date either on the packets or on the package. Nope. No expiration dates. For all I know, these could already be expired. I tried calling the manufacturer, and I just get a phone tree. When I click the only option that might be reasonable (sales), the response is ""I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your selection. Please enter that number again."" When you do this three times, Portion Pac Inc. hangs up."
positive,Delicious and long lasting for an affordable price.  What else could you want? I would definitely recommend this product. I have to type more words for this review to be published and that's why I'm still typing.
positive,I like a little honey in my coffee. This clover honey is what I like the best. Great full taste very sweet and clear. I love it.
negative,"How do you expect me to buy yhis product for this price?<br />Keurig sells the same item for only $10.75, less than half the asking price here...."
positive,Just filled a few of the capsules yesterday with my own coffee.  It was a little messy but used the capsules this morning and they worked just fine.  A lot less expensive than buying capsules from the company.
negative,"Very time consuming to peel off paper around edge of capsule, usually pulls off sticky part, so push sticky ring back down around tiny rim in a circle, then try to separate foil lids one by one, add the rubber ring and gently push up around bottom rim of capsule (which fell off on half of the capsules I tried), tamp in expensive ground coffee I purchased, makes a mess, then insert in machine and lots of water pours into tray on bottom!  Surely someone can invent some easier solution for more coffee choices for the Pixie machine.  Waste of money and time all around!"
negative,there is not enough pressure on it and it gives weak espresso looks like a watery coffee.. Threw them all :(
negative,"It isn't just a quick simple thing, they don't fit the newest nespresso machines, so there is a little black rubber ring that you put on I think?!? underneath the lid (no directions, just a note saying they don't fit anymore so you have to use the little package of rings in addition to adding the foil lid)I'd return them, but it's not worth the shipping fee."
negative,"Manufacturer refused to admit problem with their capsules when it doesn't work.<br /><br />Problem:<br />1. 1/3 to 1/2 capsules ends in very dilute coffee/dirty hot water<br />2. seal by far not perfect<br />3. foil cap not reliable peforated<br />4. used capsule compartment becomes overflow hot water compartment and sometimes overflow<br /><br />Since the manufacturer says the problem is not theirs, I tried many permutation to make the capsules work, including:<br />1. filling grinds to different level, full to not-so-full<br />2. compacting grind to different degree, from no compaction to hard compaction<br />3. using 1 or 2 rubber seal<br /><br />Results remain unreliable. When it works it works great. That's about 1/5 of the time. 1/3 of the time it is acceptable, the rest of the time I wasted the coffee and money on the capsule. In the end, it turns out to be more expensive than the nespresso capsules. Not worth the effort and frustration to get a cup of coffee nicer than nespresso's own only for 1/5 of the time."
negative,"I have the nespresso tassimo machine and I love it. I also love starbuck christmas blend and have missed it since I got my machine. I thought these little caps would do the trick. They kind of work. The resulting coffee is pretty watery- the capsule look like they are not sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the machine, they are shrunken after use- unlike the real nespresso capsules. The coffee that comes out (again I am talking starbuck christmas blend) tastes fine, but is weak in overall strength and looks really watery. PLUS after foaming up my milk and adding it to the coffee- the coffee instanly 'melts/pops' all of the foam. Nespresso must do something to their coffee to make it not do this. I find this a point none of the other reviews touch upon."
negative,"Before I bought the Essenza, I saw all of the youtube videos of reusable caps. But I didn't know Nespresso started new technology in mid to late 2010 to defeat the use of refillable capsules.  My Essenza is one of the ""new"" ones.  These don't work in the Essenzas made in mid to late 2010."
negative,"I tried to use it took me,a lot of time to filled them up and they don't even work  they were  leaking  and  the quality of the material they used was very<br />Poor"
negative,"Nespresso capsules have a domed bottom.  These are flat bottomed and absolutely will not work in newer Nespresso machines (after 2010 I think).  If the capsules for your Nespresso machines has a domed bottom, save your money, it will not work in your machine."
negative,"I have to echo a lot of the other reviews:<br /><br />1.  The capsules are about 60% the size of the standard Nespresso capsules, so unless you like your coffee very weak, these Ne-Caps are not for you.  Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the ""dirty coffee"" problem, this is a Two Star product."
negative,"I tried these on my Pixie machine, and since the capsules are not really made for it but older machines, they don't work well for newer models. The retrofit ring the capsules come with are a cheap band aid. I tried around 20 capsules before giving up. Most of the time there was excessive water flowing into the reservoir due to said incompatibility with the newer machines like my Pixie. I cannot speak for the older models.<br />There is also an environmental issue:<br />Once used, the ne caps are done and go into the garbage -  cutting the lid and using the grind for mulch is a good idea. However reusing them seems pointless and it is harder to separate the plastic from the aluminum left over lid than with the Nespresso type which is all aluminum.<br /><br />The better and much cheaper option: REUSE THE ORIGINAL NESPRESSO CAPSULES<br />I cut open and empty the regular Nespresso capsules to use the grind for mulch, then after washing and drying refill them at least once for another round with my favorite Espresso, crema type. The lid is a simple aluminum foil cut from standard foil roll (you can make multiple lids at the same time by layering foil pieces then cutting the circular lids with a scissor all at once. Make sure the circle is not too big, it should not extend too far up the capsule cone but stay neatly wrapped around the lip. Otherwise it can be leaky). Here a good link<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This means every so often you have to buy new capsules, but refilling them probably cuts the cost per capsule by 50% min. if used 2-3 times."
negative,"easy to fill with your favourite coffe, but sometimes they don't fit perfectly to the Nespresso machine so they get ruined when you pull the lever. But a few times it fits ok and does it's work. As if it had a bit of a trick to fit into the cap slot, or at least with our coffe machine... The truth is that after a while you get tired and upset of wasting so many caps and coffee. In other words it doesn't work, they shouldn't be selling this scam!"
negative,"You might think my great expectations for the Ne-Caps are the cause of the lower rating.  With a burr coffee grinder & a wide assortment of coffee beans I enjoyed grinding my own coffee and topping off the Ne-Caps.  It took a bit of time and care but I didn't mind.<br /><br />However, we have a Nespresso Clitiz and the Ne-Caps, even with the fitting rubber band required for this unit are a bit problematic.  They do not easily slide into the the Nespresso compartment.  The coffee is adequate, nothing to write home about.<br /><br />30 Ne-Caps into the process, I'm glad I tried it but won't be doing it again."
negative,"I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time."
positive,"Not a slave to someone else's taste anymore, now I can brew my favorite coffee with my favorite machine. Match made in heaven!"
negative,Watched the video and had two people attempt to fill and use pods. Machine just crushes pods from water pressure. These are useless in these machines.
negative,This product is not worth it. The capsules do not work in the Nespresso machines at all. And they are not easy to fill. I would not waste my money on this item.
positive,"I was skeptical at first, but since I like to drink nespresso (ristretto/arpeggio) as well as coffee from moka I thought I'd try. These capsule are not perfect, but provide a good alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- you can grind the coffee you like (I have used, so far, Illy beans and beans from the KC Roasterie)<br />- coffe has a density and creaminess typical of Italian baristas, you can actually taste the layers of the beans and the (small) crema blends well with the coffee<br />- you can save some money, or get better quality beans for the same price as Nespresso<br /><br />CONS:<br />- it takes a while to practice with these capsules (at least 20)<br />- coffe has still some variability (occasionally it comes out watery, but when it is well done it is way better than Nespresso)<br />- it's a bit messy (so not good for your office machine)<br />- foil does not always seal perfectly<br /><br />With time, I realized that the following steps improve a lot the quality of the espresso you get:<br />1. poor small amounts in your capsule and press heavily each time (secret for a good and rich espresso is how the water goes through the coffee)<br />2. seal tight eliminating as much air as possible<br />3. MAKE A RISTRETTO. If you drink long Nespressos, this is not for you, as the coffee will not be strong enough. The amount of coffee in the cup should be about 1/3 of a small cup with illy logo (yes, very little, that's why it is called espresso).<br /><br />I will buy these products again and try with other beans.  Personally, I often get tired of the fake crema of Nespresso and the limited availability of strong and intense ristretto varieties."
negative,"the product does work and it is a much more cost effective way to supply your nespresso machine with coffee. i didnt want to spend the $60 for another batch of the nespresso packets and these work but they dont fit perfectly and you have to insert them perfectly or they fall through the loading door, if they were a little longer this problem would probably go away. i have the pixie model and love making just one cup of coffe in the evening."
positive,"These empty plastic capsules and precut foil lids work just fine in the Nespresso Pixie I have. Their cost is much less than the filled ones purchased from Nespresso, but you do have to fill them - and you need to purchase high quality coffee or you won't get a high quality cup o' joe.  For a little work and a much lower price, I say, ""Go get 'em!""  They're easy to fill and easy to use. I bought 'em on Amazon."
negative,"I was truly disappointed when I received this product.  It didn't work with my machine, and it was a total Waste of money."
negative,"this is a comment and review of the Ne-Cap Nespresso® Compatible Refillable Capsules for Machines Before and After 2010.<br /><br />This product is the most dissapointing item ever purchased from Amazon. The seller and Amazon have no responsibility in this matter but you as a customer must know this product is VERY POORLY DESIGNED AND SOLD WITH UNREAL EXPECTIONS. I am fooled once in a while but If you wish to purchase something that is very hard to handle, tops do no seal, you will loose at least half of all pods you make and it is really poor product. Dont waste you money and time on this product."
negative,I do not know  how anyone can get these to make a cup of anything. They are not made for Nespresso le Cube Thats for certain. It's unfortunate the company wastes peoples time with this. They probably assume most people will not spend the time and money to return these. The cups are visibly not as long and therefore do not get holes punched at both ends like the original. Maybe some machines they work but the company would do a service to potential  customers by not wasting everyones time and letting people know they do not work on the Le Cube at least. It doesn't even deserve 1 star but Amazon requires a star to be put to review.
negative,"I read a few reviews about this product and several warned me, but I purchased anyway...when will I learn to listen!  I wasted my money, the bad reviews I read were very accurate!  The thin plastic capsules that you put together to make the pod are flimsy and a bit short in length to be correctly punctured by the machine, they are no comparison to the metal original mfg's capsules!  Most of the times I tried ...the capsule bent when pressed by machine creating water leakage and a very small amount of weak watery espresso that was thrown out.  I will report them to you ...as a waste of my hard earned dollars!  It's time we consumers speak out... I believe that this company knows they are a rip-off and from the reviews I read, they don't care!  I'm going to try to contact them for a refund, others got no where when they requested $ back.  This product needs to be taken off the market...Help me Howard time!"
negative,"the original ne-caps have a domed base in aluminum, these have a flat base in plastic,and do not make proper contact to to perforate cap. total waste of money!"
negative,"Looks like product fits some espresso machines but  it is not working with nespresso ""essenza"" machine, all you can get in cup just<br />light brown water"
negative,This is a waste of money & the machine is a waste of money.  I got all this as a gift.  If the makers weren't ripoff artists they would have made  it easy to put your own coffee in...like Keurig did.  This product is just a lot of marketing hype.  Not even remotely worth the money.
negative,"I first read about this snack cracker in the book, Cinch, by Cynthia Sass. They arrived in a timely fashion. They tasted okay. They were sealed in a plastic container. So far so good. But, by the time I could get to the second carton, mealy worms were hatching.  So two and one half containers are useless and cannot be returned. Buyer beware."
negative,"These cracker seem to be on the healthy side but their hard as a rock, will not be buying them again."
positive,"These are great, but just be aware that there is a lot of fiber here so drink plenty of water to avoid that weird bloated feeling.  (Sometimes I have to remind myself)  Happy eating!"
negative,I really like Sylvia's seasoning so I thought the beans would be good too.....they are but there's more liquid than beans!!! It was more like bean soup. I happen to have a can of Black-eyed peas in the cupboard that I added to the HOPPIN JOHNS. That made it much better.  The taste is great but you shouldn't have to add more beans.
positive,"These broccoli seeds sprout fine, though the sprouts seem to grow slower/smaller than the more expensive broccoli seeds I've bought through SproutPeople. I usually grow the sprouts for 72-84 hours. With 4 tablespoons of SproutPeople seeds, 3 or 3.5 days's growth will fill about 3/4 of my EasySprout container. With Sprout House seeds, the sprouts fill up only about 50% of the container. Just about all the seeds sprouted, though."
negative,"Broccoli sprouts are one of my favorite sprouts to grow and eat. I tried the sprout house brand for the first time and was really disappointed with these sprouts. They turned out bitter and really spicy. They also spoiled much faster than other broccoli sprouts that I've used in the past. Overall, I was disappointed and would not waste my money again on sprouts from the sprout house!"
positive,they arrived promptly and are very tasty.<br />The price was much lower than other stores and i would highly recommend these to EVERYONE.
positive,"Excellent quality and of course excellent nutrition. All seeds sprout. I have mine sprouting in trays under a grow lite, but it isn't necessary, especially in the summer. They just need to be near a sunny window. Sprout house is a very quality vender too. Always there to answer questions and offer help. Very informative website. UPDATE: I bought some easy sprout sprouters and I get tons of great broccoli sprouts in record time!"
negative,I too have a problem with these seeds taking too long to sprout.  I would like a return of my money.
positive,This coffee is about what you might get at your local 7-11 or AM/PM gas station. Not bad..Not good...and not what I would consider premium coffee. If you normally drink Folgers or Maxwell House..give this a try.<br />If Starbucks is more your style..try something else.
positive,Great taste and getting this on auto ship helps and saves money since coffee is so high. This is always a treat to brew.
negative,"I planted several seeds hoping for several plants. Unfortunately, out of about 5 (using 2-3 seeds per pot) only one germinated. I am very disappointed."
positive,"A pack of 12 is a huge amount of noodles. They are standard sized packages, like spaghetti noodle sized packages. The price when I bought it was better than the price at the grocery store. Eden is a high-end brand that I really trust. There is a difference between these and ones made in China. I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Hope that helps."
positive,"Can't miss with this when you really want to give something special. Product famous for quality.  Delivered on schedule.  Great, practical packaging."
positive,The steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious. The price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came.  I would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life.
negative,"I bought the top sirloin hoping to finally get a ""good"" steak at home.<br />The first ones we cooked....could hardly cut with a steak knife.<br />The second time we tried them, I tenderized for quite some time.<br />They were more edible that way, but still nothing better than I could have bought at the local grocery store.<br /><br />Except for the packaging, there is nothing good I can say about these steaks.<br />If you figure the price per pound, these steaks should cut with a butter knife.<br /><br />Will never buy again."
negative,I ordered a box of the Omaha Steaks Top Sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather. Toughest meat I've ever had.  There was absolutely no flavor to the steak and I didn't want to waste it so I gave it to my dogs
negative,"Yeah, so I bought this from local grocery store for $1. It tastes absolutely horrible. It does not taste like ranch. ....... At all."
negative,"Yes, also bought this at the local drugstore and discovered it tastes nothing like ranch.I thought they might have put the wrong crackers into the ranch labeled container. It tastes like curry or cumin spices. I read the back and it says Made in India so I am assuming that this is what Indians translate ranch flavoring to taste like."
negative,Purchased a container of these from a local drug store... they taste like cheap curry (which is *nothing* like ranch).
positive,"This is a very high quality Tulsi product and 100% organic. Davidsons farms and harvests the Tulsi tea on their own land in India. Very well priced in comparison to other organic Tulsi found on the net. Great taste and has a very relaxing, de-stressing effect which I love. I also buy Rooibos tea from Davidsons which I mix with the Tulsi for an even better relaxing and healthy cup. Highly Recommended!"
negative,"My Tulsi arrived, and happy to share it, I opened it up to share with friends. What a disaster! Not only did the Tulsi contain a few bugs, it is not ""pure"" Tulsi. Though it lists three types of Tulsi, it appears to contain other elements.<br /><br />The bugs also indicate that it was not stored properly. I will be getting my tea elsewhere!"
positive,"I make tea from this , very fragrant and soothing, has kept the flu away. Even my kids drink without problem."
positive,"I sincerely hope this review doesn't confuse the potential buyer, but I found it important enough to write this.<br /><br />If you have had real Tulsi tea, in the sense, if you had a Tulsi plant in your home, and you have made and drunk plenty of tea after crushing and boiling those fresh tulsi leaves in your tea, then this product will likely not be to your liking. It is way too strong/fragrant. So much so that it barely smells like Tulsi (which has a very mild, consistent smell).<br /><br />What I'd like to stress to you at this point is that ""way too strong"" may exactly be what you love; but I didn't. I'll have to go back to the more expensive Teatulia tea bags for ""my"" preferred taste.<br /><br />I'll also add that the bag I received says USDA certified organic. Don't think it said that here on the Amazon description.<br /><br />Hope you find your Tulsi tea!!!!"
positive,"""Organic"" means that something in there was/might be organic.  This claims to be 100% organic.  USDA organic does not mean much any more.  I'm not sure what NDA is.<br /><br />Mine has an expiration date of 11/22/13.  It does not have a picked date. I wish it did.  Normal teas are best no more than a year from the picking date.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting around.<br /><br />It says it is pure leaves but there seems to be some white sticks in the mix.  And it is a mix.  Not many leaves - unlike the picture- more of a crunch.  I have to use my finest filter and some still goes through.  I don't use paper.<br /><br />A pound is a lot of tea.<br /><br />I mix it with my green tea in the am and it keeps me from getting jittery.  Tastes like Tulsi to me but... the real, fresh leaf is very fine indeed.<br /><br />And where is it from?  US, India? Belize?"
positive,"We use this syrup instead of regular colored strawberry syrup. Agave has a low glycemic index, and perfect for those who try to cut back on regular sugar. The color is not striking as artificial color, but taste is great! We mix this with organic fat free milk to make our own strawberry milk instead of buying already made strawberry milk. Sometimes my son likes to pour this on some fresh strawberries to make it a great desert."
positive,"My husband loves the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn, but it's hard to find in our area anymore....guess it doesn't sell well due to the calorie content!  I did find it on Amazon, but only in large quantities which isn't what we need. I found this topping on Amazon, and because of the reviews I decided to buy it for him to try.  He loves it!  It smells great, no rancid smell, and he says it's just as good as the stuff that is packaged with the popcorn; may be the same stuff altogether.  It's less expensive to buy this bottle and the regular boxed popcorn, than to purchase the larger quantities of the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn."
positive,"I sure like this product, as I've always loved the butter popcorn at the movies, but now I usually wait for movies to come to Blockbuster. I don't like popcorn salt alone, and had looked for a solution to my problem. This is the answer, and it's sure as heck cheaper than the $5 per bag at the cinema."
positive,"This product gives your popcorn the movie theatre butter consistency, but it doesn't seem to have much flavor.  The first time I used it, it seemed a bit grainy.  The next time, I heated it a bit before adding, and the grainyness was gone.<br /><br />I do think I will try something else though, as this was just ok."
negative,"I don't care how good this product is, it is not with the price. I was shocked to see how small the bottle was for almost 11.00."
positive,"I was reluctant to try this product, but after reviewing the reviews from other people, I thought ""what the heck....I won't be out much if it doesn't satisfy my palette"" so I decides to give it a whirl. This product could not be any closer to the real deal at the theaters. I really love this product and can't wait to order it in the gallon size. Way to go Wabash Valley Farms. Thank you for carrying this product."
negative,"Here's how my star rating scale works:  1 = water, 10 = perfect robust butter taste.<br /><br />Would you believe that butter itself, including clarified butter, has very little butter taste?  I rate real butter products a 2.<br />Most microwave popcorn is too buttery to the point of going back down the scale.  I rate their butter taste (if we could extract and bottle their butter flavor)  around a 4 for being far too intense.<br /><br />Wabash Buttery Topping, unfortunately, does taste like butter - meaning it has very little buttery taste.  This is why I have given it the same rating as actual butter.  If you like this product, I recommend making or buying clarified butter instead, to save money, since they taste the same.<br /><br />So my search continues for a good buttery topping."
negative,Absolutely terrible the worst thing I have every tasted. Do not buy waste of money!<br /><br />i threw it out after first use
negative,"Bad tasting. Smelled bad in bottle and tasted bad on popcorn...even after salting. If you want calories and bad taste ! Please order this product. I tried it several times thinking I did something wrong, and it is not so. Try it on your skin it may be the best beauty product ever! As for popcorn, serve it only to your husband's football buds. After a few beers ... A good way to get rid of it. That's what I'M going to do."
negative,Too expensive comes out to over a dollar per ounce there are others at a better value.Now it's telling me I need to write more words.
positive,"I got hooked on this chai when I decided to give up coffee.  It still has a little bit of caffeine, but much less than coffee does.  It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.  This stuff tastes ""real"" and without chemicals or preservatives."
positive,"This masala chai is absolutely delicious!  It is definitely more spicy than the average American vanilla chai, and it is definitely more traditional than modern vanilla chai.<br /><br />Because of the yummy spices, you'll be able to feel your tummy being warmed up!  Num!<br /><br />This is a delicious product that is inexpensive because it makes so many cups of chai in a small package.  You only need a very small amount per cup, added to warm milk.  No complaints here!"
positive,"Starbucks Sumatra has always been my favorite, so I was excited when the K-cup finally came out. Overall, they did a very good job. But one big caveat: If you get a Tall or Grande at Starbucks, one K-cup is not going to a good substitute. The largest setting on a Keurig platinum is 12oz, which is a Tall in Starbucks lingo. I've enjoyed this at 8oz, but too much of a sacrifice at larger settings. What this means is I typically need 2 K-cups for my morning fix. This can be an issue for any of the bold coffees, but since I've been a Starbucks Sumatra drinker for years, I notice it more---in taste and in my wallet. I'll continue to buy this, but I'm also drinking Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M9ZLEG"">Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>It's cheaper and I can use the 10 oz setting."
negative,This comment has been removed by the user since it applies only to bagged versions of Sumatra and not K-cup variety.
negative,Took a chance on these. AWFUL! I know Starbucks is known for burnt tasting coffee but this is ridiculous. I actually like their in-store brewed coffees. Never tasted coffee THIS burnt before. Try Green Mountain Barista Prima (French Roast is da bomb!). A gazillion times better this stuff.
positive,"We love this soup, but it is hard to find in stores. When I saw this item on Amazon for the good price, plus free shipping , just had to get it. We eat a lot of it in the cold months. We cook groundbeef, then add everything in the pouch, and it is wonderful and tasty."
positive,"This soup mix has been sold in stores for many years. When I recently went to the store to buy more, I found it was no longer available. In checking online, I found the soup mix on Amazon. The mix is great - add stew meat, any vegetables, mushrooms, diced tomatoes - whatever you want to add. For two people you get 6 1/2 good tasting meals out of one package. We freeze the leftovers in individual containers. Very economical and good tasting!"
positive,"My local grocers stopped carrying all soup mixes with dehydrated veggies. I like dehydrated veggies. I prefer the Bear Creek soup mix but noticed that Mrs. Grass, which I like also, was much cheaper. It arrived promptly in a really big box. I have eaten all of them. I will probably order again."
positive,This is a great tasting product. Cannot find it in major supermarkets anymore. Happy to find it online. Highly recommend it.
positive,"Easy to make and a filling soup. It is hard to find in any stores in my area so am very happy Amazon has the mix for sale. I can eat the soup even though I am on Weight Watchers! If you want, you can add extra noodles and carrots when extra company arrives! Short time to cook. Love the soup!"
positive,I was so thrilled to find this soup at a decent price. I look in every grocery and department store I go in but haven't been able to find it for a couple of years. I'm not sure why it is so hard to find because according to the reviews it is a much-loved product. Initially Amazon said it would take 8-10 weeks to ship but as soon as the order was placed they bumped that up & I received it in about a week. We are so happy to have our soup in the house for the winter!
positive,"This is one of our favorite soup mix, but unfortunately it's becoming very hard to find in the grocery stores. Great price, fast dilivery."
positive,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I love soup mixes.  I know that making home made soup is easy, and even fun if you have the time.  But nothing beats a mix that can be dumped into a pot with some browned beef, or any other optional ingredient you favor, and have it be ready and delicious in 20 minutes or less.  Mrs. Grass is a very good mix compared to a lot of the ones more easily available in the stores.  It taste a little more like home made to me.  And believe me I haves tried all of them available in the stores.  The only reason I refer to it as second best if because I also buy the Bear Creek veggie beef soup mix also available on Amazon, (link enclosed).  I have to give the nod here to Bear Creek for just being a little spicier, and in my opinion having just a tad better beef broth.  I still highly recommend Mrs. Grass for it is much better than the store bought mixes, and besides, you may like your soup a little on the lighter side.  Still very tasty, and very worth it... Recommended.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25WMC"">Bear Creek Country Kitchens Vegetable Beef Soup Mix, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
positive,"i have been using this beef soup mix for years. absolutely delicious. best out there and becoming increasingly harder to find. i bought 8 so i will not be driving alllll over town looking for it. grab it...so easy to make and i always add barley,corn and jalapeno's to it. YUMMY!!! please never discontinue!!!!"
positive,"Thoughts of great soup on cold days went out the window when we could no longer find this product in our stores.  We tried others, and nothing compared.  As always, Amazon comes through and we are happy campers again."
negative,I buy this soup in grocery stores for $2.99 per package. Here the cost is $4.24 per package.
positive,"I spotted this Mae Ploy sweet Chili Sauce (12-ounce bottle) in the international section of a local grocery store. It's imported from Thailand. I use regular chili sauce in a variety of ways and I love to try variants such as this. Into the shopping cart it went. Well, my, oh my, this stuf is excellent. It's both sweet and somewhat hot and has a nice variety of spicy flavors dominated by pickled red chili. So far, I've used it on eggs and small frozen dinners. Excellent. I can hardly wait to try it out on meats. This is, indeed, a very interesting variation from my ordinary chili sauce!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
positive,"The CHARLES BAR is absolutely the most delicious, creamy, gourmet Belgian Chocolate I have ever tasted! It is a Truffle consistency and melts in your mouth. I don't know which I like more the dark or milk!! You won't believe it is sugar and gluten free as there is no aftertaste or anything artificial about the chocolate. Like Charles says on his commercial..""It doesn't get any better than this"" and it's true!! Grab one and see for yourself."
negative,"Seriously?!!!! Have you read the product features? It Says ""Place in large critter keeper for frogs to burrow."" What the hell???!! Does anybody preview/edit this stuff? I volunteer."
positive,"I make my own coffee flavoring syrup to save money, however the most expensive part is the extract. This is easily one of the best values I've found for bulk almond extract. The seller is reliable and ships very fast and I will most likely purchase more in the future."
negative,This product is not what is seems.  I thought it would come in a brown bottle but it came it a plastic clear container.  I would not have purchasedit.  The product is just o.k..
positive,I got these to put in the girls' favor bags at my daughter's 3rd birthday party and they were a big hit!  The package that we received had a nice variety with at least one of each princess.  There were more Cinderellas than any other princess.  These are well priced versus what you would pay for them individually at a grocery store.
positive,"I bought these to give out as party favors at a bridal shower--my sister got engaged at Disneyland, and they're going on a Disney cruise for their honeymoon, so it seemed like a nice touch.<br /><br />The guests loved them!<br /><br />My pack included: 2 Ariel, 2 Cinderella, 2 Belle, 3 Aurora, 1 Frog Princess, 2 Rapunzel.  So, obviously it's just a random assortment.<br /><br />They make great favors because they're already individually wrapped.  Also, they do come with the little display like shown in the picture here on Amazon.  When my guests were leaving, I just put them out in their display box for them to pick up on their way out, and I used labels to put a sticker for the event on the packages.<br /><br />If you want Pez dispensers that are Disney princesses, this is a great option."
negative,I bought these for my daughter's birthday.  She was excited at first but her favorite princess is Sleeping Beauty and there were not any in the entire box.  Seriously?  They can't ensure that there is at least 1 of each princess?
negative,"I'm glad that they added ""IMITATION"" to the title of this product because when I purchased it it just indicated that the product was Lemon Extract, but that is not what I received (Also, the receipt that I printed when I ordered shows the title as Lemon Extract, 16 oz).  I received IMITATION Lemon Extract.  The two are not the same.  After I received it, I checked the description and it indicated that it was imitation, but the title was also changed by the time I checked.  Other than that little issue, it was shipped on time and packed well."
positive,"I decided to try this coffee and went with subscribe and save to get a discount. I figured I could always cancel if I didn't like it. Well I love it. My only problem is that I run out of it before the next month's supply gets in. It's bold and strong, so if you like that in your coffee flavor, this is for you. Reminds me a bit of a starbucks type of coffee. I Loved It."
positive,"Here's a product that had the potential to be excellent but isn't.  Since it's not a ""K-Cup"", they're not paying the licensing fees, so it should be cheaper.  Yet it's about the same price as many brands of K-Cups.  What makes it worse is that these aren't even ""extra bold"" portions, the ones with extra coffee in the cup, which again you can get for about the same price as these.<br /><br />On the positive side, there's less material here, so less waste generated.  I've bought this brand of coffee in bean form for years, the ""not a K-Cup"" version does deliver the familiar tastes.  A small cup of the same taste."
positive,"I have been using this brand, in my six year-old Keurig, for about a year now.<br /><br />I like the flavor, not quite as rich as I like, but for the price, it's fine.<br /><br />There is a bit more sediment at the bottom of the cup, but for the price, it works for me.<br /><br />The main difference I see between these ""pod-like"" k-cups and the k-cups is a lot more drips after the coffee is brewed. I just wipe under the cup holder and the drip tray a bit more often.<br /><br />I do get these, the 80 count, at Costco for $24.79 a box, coming to 31 cents per cup (compared to Amazon purchase at $33 for 41cents/cup or Amazon subscribe at $33.35, for 39 cents per cup). But if those prices change I would not hesitate to switch to Amazon for my source."
positive,I don't drink coffee but I got it for my Husband.  He said it is pretty good.  We just got the Hazelnut in which he likes much better.  I love the price!
positive,Good flavor but it is a little weak!!!! if it was made stronger the flavor would come in!!!! All in all Good enough for the price
positive,"Of all the flavors and kinds of coffee, this one is my son's favorite.  I enjoy it, too.  It tastes like a good home brewed coffee, fresh everytime.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
positive,"With the high cost of K-cups I've tried several different alternatives.  I have the My K cup and the Eco-cup and they both work ok but just not great.  The 3 adults in our home all love coffee and drink lots of it so the cost was getting to be a problem.<br />I've compared K cup prices everywhere, online and brick and mortar stores.  I usually purchase from Amazon.<br />Was checking out what was available and ran across these.  I love the Millstone Fog Lifter coffee so I was interested but read the review and found that they were made differently.  I hesitated but decided to try the 36 ct box.  I figured if I didn't like them somebody else might.  Was still skeptical and thought it might not work in my Keurig.<br />Works perfectly!  The Fog Chaser is delicious.  I like bold coffee and this is good strong but not bitter coffee.  I highly recommend it and others love it too.  We have a Keurig at work and I took one of the bags and shared.  Everybody loved it.  Also, though I'm not usually into ""being green"" particularly I feel that there is less plastic to end up in the landfills."
positive,"Another great coffee from San Francisco Bay. This roast,like their Fog Chaser, are great first morning cup of coffee.  I then switch to their decaf French Roast for the rest of the day. I have used all three of these roasts as a bases for mochas and Irish coffee.  They maintain their flavor very well. Recommend to any coffee lover. Their unique K-cup design uses less plastic which is nice for the environment."
positive,"After reading the reviews we werent quite sure what to expect, but we are delighted. The packaging is much better environmentally and the key is that we dont have to compromise on taste or convenience. And by the way its a lot cheaper. The coffee is robust, strong and dark, like it should be ( I haven't tried the other flavors) and it has a great aroma. Of the four people who tried it in our office this morning three are buying it for home and the fourth is concerned only because it is too strong for his family's taste. The packaging is different but works as well as the regular k-cups. I am definitely buying this in the future"
positive,"Deep, dark, rich flavor. I appreciate the reduced packaging which is environmentally friendly, and as a side benefit takes up less space.  What I really like about these, besides the great flavor (best tasting K-cups I've found so far) is that there is just the filter on the bottom. I've always had some un-addressed concerns about the composition of the plastic that other k-cups are made of, and what may be leaching into my beverage from the hot water passing over the coffee.  Look for these at costco where a 80 pack is 25$ (look around, not all stores carry them), but even on amazon it's a good deal with shipping included."
positive,This is now the only coffee I order for my Keurig.  The quality is much better than i initially expected and the price is great.  At first when i saw the k-kup it was different so i expected it not to work but after the first coffee I was hooked.  This tastes to me like a starbucks flavor with the full body boldness.  I would definitely recommend especially for with the subscription discount.
positive,"The subscribe & save service is good, the product was delivered as required and actually did save me money! The coffee is great and has a good full bodied taste, delicious and keeps me wide awake while working."
positive,Received product very quickly.  The k-cups taste fresh and robust compared to other Keurig cartridges. I will definitely be ordering for my office again!
positive,This is by far..the BEST FRENCH ROAST I have ever had! Aside from that...you can't beat the packaging and the price! Talk about eco friendly. I'm all for it. I will be a forever customer as long as they keep things the same. I recommend the Subscribe & Save program.
positive,I will start with the complaint.  This little things kinda do stick to the brewer when you open it after the brewing is over. Not a big deal though.  They brew perfectly and the coffee is wonderful.
positive,This is a bold coffee with a smooth taste. For the money it is the beet tasting c.offee I have found in the market .place. I love the easy storable sturdy box.
positive,Some of the best coffee I've had. Great if you like full-bodied and rich coffee.  No bitterness and makes a good cup of coffee everytime.
positive,"This was my first product by San Francisco Bay, but won't be the last.  It works perfectly in the Keurig and the coffee is very good.  I'll continue to buy K-cups from this company."
positive,Like the packaging instead of the plastic k-cups! I believe it brews so much smoother! The price is attractive also.
positive,"For my personal taste, this coffee could be a little bit stronger.  However, it has a nice rich flavor and it starts my day everyday.  The unusual K-cup keeps all of the grounds out of my cup because there is no hole poked in the bottom of the K-cup.  The price is also very nice.  I think some of the other brands are slowly pricing themselves out of the market."
positive,"I really do like their coffee products and the prices cannot be beaten.  Yes, as the reviews state to keep them fresh requires a zip lock or container but for the cost savings that isn't a problem at all for me.  This is I believe, my third order of the SF Bay coffees."
positive,"If you have never tried San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast, Your in for a treat. This is a relatively inexpensive coffee, but has all the traits of expensive Gourmet brands.<br />  Very Rich and full bodied, without the bitterness you normally expect find from a French Roast. A full flavored experience.<br /><br />  San Fransisco Bay Coffee comes in their unique style K cup comparable one cup pack's servers.<br /><br />  A must try brand for any real coffee connoisseur."
negative,"I shouldn't label myself a coffee connoisseur, but I know bitter when I taste it. I have been testing different coffees in my new Keurig and can honestly say that this coffee is the worst of them all, thus far. No matter what size cup I brew or how much creamer and sugar I add (I normally do not use cream/sugar) the stuff in the cup goes down the drain. What a waste of money. Don't do it... If you can find a small test trial go for it, but don't invest on the 80 k-cup box because you are throwing your money away! Bleh!<br /><br />If you are worried about recycling, use the plastic k-cups to start seedlings in and punch a couple more holes in the bottom so the roots can absorb water. San Fran French Roast is garbage."
negative,"I bought this coffee after reading the reviews. I have been a black coffee drinker my whole life, but did not like this coffee. I did not have a problem with the pod.  I thought the coffee was terrible and will probably try to give it away."
positive,"This coffee is good and it certainly is worth the price, HOWEVER, there is one downfall.  While it doesn't waste plastic, if you just store your coffee k cups in a basket or an open container, it allows air to enter and thus the flavor will escape.  It's the only thing that will keep me from purchasing in the future."
positive,"We've been buying San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast in whole bean packages at a warehouse store for years, mostly because it was less expensive than the better known brands. To our surprise, we like its bold flavor better than the other brands. I always thought higher prices meant better tasting coffee. Not true! When we bought a Keurig coffee machine last January, I was resigned to trading a taste I prefer and an outstanding value, for the single cup convenience of the K-cups, which meant buying the more expensive brands of coffee in K-cups. Fortunately, the SFB Coffee people have made a single serving cup which fits in Keurig machines. It has the same flat, round top as K-cups, but the cup portion is a mesh filter cup, not made of plastic as with a K-cup. The SFBC cups work just as well in your Keurig machine and with less waste. I take a 16-oz. travel mug to work each morning, and I find the flavor to be consistent whether I make 8 ounces or 16 ounces. My sister-in-law's husband calls himself a coffee snob. He tried the SFBC French Roast for the first time today and was blown away by its rich flavor. He's now a believer and has ordered his first case."
positive,The price of the pods was very inviting compared to the Timothy's brand. I purchased the French Roast Decaf for my wife and the regular French Roast for myself. We both drink our coffee black and found it favorful and not at all bitter. I highly recommend San Francisco Bay French Roast.
positive,5 Stars on flavor. I was concerned about the design of this 'Kcup' but its sturdy. The only thing that would make this coffee better would be if the packaging was resealable. Its annoying that I have to put them in their own zip lock once the plastic bag is cut.
positive,The coffee is excellent! Having it delivered makes it convienent and the 80 count lasts long enough for two of us for  a month. Willl definitely keep this coming!
positive,"When reading the other reviews, I was hesitant to get it, but I am glad I did!  The smell from opening one of the mini bags in the box was amazing, definitely proving it to be a ""French Roast.""  The taste isn't as strong as other French Roast coffees, but that's fine with me.  This brews up perfectly in my Keurig, and tastes amazing!  I definitely would recommend it, especially if you don't like the stronger French Roast blends."
positive,"I was pleased with this brand of K-cup coffee.  Instead of coming in a small plastic (not very green!) container it comes in a mesh-like pouch making the coffee flow through it easier.  i have a hundred dollar Keurig machine and it stopped making coffee from the plastic containers.  Coffee everywhere.  i was ready to throw it out in disgust until i tried this new model of single brewing cup.  The taste is bold, although I prefer bolder, but it is fresh, dependable and works everytime."
positive,"I had given up on the Keurig after trying several different coffees as it always lacked in strength and flavor.  I had tried many varieties of the various branded versions of Green Mountain Coffee, aka all K-cups are packaged by Green Mountain.  I finally retired the brewer after the last bad cup having a distinct plastic taste, to a shelf in the basement. Then walking through Costco came across these pods, and different is better!  They seem to have more coffee grounds resulting in stronger coffee, are less expensive, and your beverage is not brewed through a plastic cup.  By far the best coffee for the Keurig and I am looking forward to trying some of the different roasts and blends and really glad to see they are available through Amazon Prime, as Costco is often there one minute gone the next trip."
positive,"I am a coffee fanatic.  This coffee is delicious!  As good if not better than other brands, and the price is reasonable."
positive,"We love our Keurig machine but found the kcups to be expensive.  This brand of coffee offers a strong, bold cup of coffee and at a lower price point that most of the others.<br /><br />We have the box of 80 delivered every month, very convenient."
positive,"I've tried a lot of different Keurig K cup and pod brands. This coffee is the best. And, I love the new style K kup. It's more effecient and more ECO friendly."
positive,"I hesitated buying these quasi K-cups fearing they would not have good flavor, not fit right or spew grounds into my cup.  All those concerns were unfounded!  I have tried just about every dark roast coffee put into a K-cup and this is the best and at half the price...that is called value.  I have purchased hundreds of items on Amazon and this is the first one I felt compelled to review because I assume others have the same ""it is too go to be true"" feeling that I had.  Now I am going to use the subscribe and save feature and save a little more."
positive,"This coffee is my all-time favorite, beating Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.  The flavor is rich and bold.  The pod design is eco-friendly, the price CAN'T BE BEAT.  I will continue to order this item.  It is the best coffee I've ever had!"
positive,"Awesome, San Francisco Bay French roast is the best.....without the bitter bite, dark  smooth......smells and tastes GREAT......we love it.....we will be buying more!"
positive,"Quality taste at a great price -(especially with subscribe and save). Took a chance on something new and that looked a little different and I'm glad I did.  After I open a pouch of K-Cups, I put them in a zip-lock bag.  My cup of coffee is fresh and delicious.  Try it.  You'll like it."
positive,"I am not a coffee critic, but this is some dang good coffee.  Although I did not get it for the $28.00 others refernce, I did pay $33.00 and feel that is a good buy, at least $12.00 less than Sam's Club for what I feel is better coffee.  I like the little pods, will composts them when I decide to compost."
positive,"I've been a San Francisco Bay coffee fan for years, and was delighted to learn of their one-cups.  The flavor is great and the pods are eco-friendly.  I like my coffee strong and have found the French Roast to be just right.  Don't know what a reviewer meant by ""weak and watery.""  Not so!  I like the price too."
positive,"A truly tasty French roast and I love the the packaging--feels more like brewing coffee, allows savory aroma to waft.  Packs a caffeine punch yet delicious flavor. Will buy again."
positive,"I was  so excited  to try  these in spite of all the negative reviews that tried to scare me away -  maybe some folks were confused  by the title  however  please note **these are not K Cups -  they  are One cup  made to  work  with  our  beloved Keurig K-Cup Brewers.<br />Thank  goodness -  for any of you  who have  had to deal with  that  puff of  air sending  the K Cups  coffee  grounds up inside the  Kuerig needle  which after  only one use can  clog  the needle. I thought I was  going crazy going through the process of returning  my Kuerig  which was still full of water back to either  Amazon or in my case Costco - because I  thought it was just a lemon -  yeah,  did that 4 times -<br />The beauty of these little One Cup filters is that  they are  not vacuum sealed -<br />I  keep mine in a  large  glass, clamp lidded jar.....The freshness  is  a divine improvement -  and  less waste  in the landfill ...every little bit helps... So far, no bitter taste and I am loving  these..."
positive,I have tried each of these New K-cup like items from San Francisco Bay.  This one is darker than the Rainforest blend but not as dark as the Fog Chaser (my personal favorite).<br /><br />Great coffee...great alternative!
positive,"I've been drinking this brand of coffee for many years.  I was delighted to see them come out in a Keurig compatible form.  Because they're not really ""K-Cups"" they don't have to pay the licensing fee, so they can sell for a lower price.<br /><br />The One Cup pods deliver the exact same taste as the beans, a good rich French Roast.<br /><br />Because these are pods and not sealed cups, they should be stored in an airtight container or they will go stale very rapidly.  The box is subdivided into smaller sealed bags, each bag holds a few days worth of cups for the two of us at my house."
positive,"I like strong coffee. I should get that out of the way first, because I know not everyone appreciates deep, dark coffees. Aside from Dark Magic and Mahogany, this is better than almost every k-cup I have tasted.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the filter-like bottom of these pods over the k-cup for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I've noticed no difference in freshness compared to the Nitrogen-filled, sealed k-cup.<br /><br />2. I don't have to waste filtered water and keep a paper clip handy to unclog the coffee grounds that get stuck in the needle of the Keurig because of pressure and temperature differences between where the k-cup was sealed and where it gets punctured.<br /><br />3. When brewing with these One Cups, the kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee, an aroma I had missed when using k-cups.<br /><br />4. (And I realize not everyone will feel this way) - warning, nothing but complaining ahead:<br /><br />I had begun resenting being beholden to Keurig. I dutifully sent them money each month for k-cups and each month they found new ways to make me regret it. (Not shipping the k-cups out at all, allowing my package to sit in their warehouse for a week while they assured me it was on its way, consistently being out of stock of the k-cups I wanted and most of all, whenever I called or wrote to point out a problem, issuing a coupon code for free k-cups but then repeating the problem the following month. Their customer service dept is structured in a way that they repeat problems and never resolve anything.)"
positive,"great cup of coffee. i MUST have these or else :) i am very fussy about my coffee. these are in a sealed bag, when opened a burst of fresh coffee hits you...which i never had with k cups. they are a whole new way of enjoying your keurig coffee makers. i sooooooooo highly recommend san francisco bay coffee ..especially french roast"
positive,These K Cups provided strong coffee without sediment in the bottom of the cup. I think the taste was deeper then the usual K cups and I felt better about not having the plastic on the bottom.
positive,"I was a little hesitant about ordering these after reading multiple reviews that talked about the foil breaking and spilling the grounds everywhere.  But I'm glad I went ahead and made the purchase.  The coffee tastes great and after getting almost completely through the first bag (12 ""pods"" in each amazon frustration-free package) I have been very happy.  No spillage and a great, strong and flavorful cup of coffee."
positive,"For the past year, I have had a monthly shipment of the Diedrich French Roast sent to my house.  When they discontinued the subscribe and save for that product I was very disappointed and had to find a new french roast.  After reading the reviews I decided to give the San Francisco Bay a try.  I was a bit skeptical about the package and I am very picky about taste, however, I just brewed my first cup and I love it!  It has a really rich flavor that seems to have more of the natural oils that you would find in a french press.  Sounds crazy, but it seems to be true!  The aroma is wonderful as well.  I haven't gotten to the end of my first cup quite yet so I don't know if there is more sediment, but hey, I like french press so a little sediment won't kill me.  I plan to make this coffee my new subscribe and save."
negative,"I love the beans, but this design of the cup is not good-- the cups are not sealed all the way and after the first few cups, the coffee starts to get stale unless you vacuum seal the k-cups.  I would say hold off on purchasing these unless you go through them quickly or can find a way to store them."
positive,I thought that the flavor was good - it tasted more like a real cup of coffee - like one that was brewed traditionally. But this French roast was just too strong to me. Almost a little bitter.<br /><br />I prefer the San Francisco Bay cup style over the plastic K-cup. And I will be trying a lighter roast.
positive,"These coffee pods work great in the Keurig Brewer, and if you like the flavors available these are a good value, but at our local warehouse club (BJ's New England) we got a box of 80 for around $28.00. This is way less than here at Amazon. I hope they create more flavors. As for the ""off taste"" other reviewers are complaining about this coffee is a branch of Peets Coffee. They roast a lot differently than Green Mountain Coffee, the people who bring you the Keurig brewers. I find the coffee to be robust and a lot less bitter than Starbucks, but more bitter than, say, a Dunkin Donuts coffee.<br /><br />I would buy these again and again, but as I said, our local warehouse store had them for even less. Shop around!"
negative,I like strong coffee...I LOVE strong coffee and drink it black. This coffee is not really strong but it is quite bitter and has an odd taste to it. Reminds me of 8 o clock French Roast which I also do not like. If you like 8 o clock French Roast you will likely like this one. I like San Franciscos Fog Chaser much better and make it on the stongest setting of my brewer.
positive,Love the pod design. Going to try the French Roast next.<br />I am a coffe snob and I admit it! This is great coffee!
positive,"Wonderful coffee at a great price!!! I haven't tried other beans, but the French roast is delicious. Happy to have auto ship too - keeps my keruig busy and my taste buds happy!"
positive,As others have written - a K-Cup knock off with nice full flavor - 10oz. setting is good for me - great value - nice bold flavor - best option I have tried so far.
positive,I usually drink this in the af'noon and find it perfect mild bold drink using 1/2 the amount of water required. the aroma is wonderful and the brew flavors expand as you mull the first few sip around in your mouth..the wife also finds it her 2nd choice as Nantucket grabs her attentions 1st. This is not a Kpod but has a mesh bottom..thus I found it tended to lose floavor if not sealed in plastic bag...just an heads up for new customers.
positive,Our favorite coffee is Donut Shop by Coffee People and we were curious with this new type of Kcup. Although not the same as Donut Shop this coffee has a wonderful flavor. If you like a strong full bodied flavor use the middle setting otherwise the 10 ounce setting will still give you a very full bodied coffee without being watered down. All in all we will definitely be ordering this again. The best at .44 cents a cup this is a great value.
negative,"I tried this coffee because of the price being less than most k-cups here on Amazon.  It's very strong coffee using the largest setting on our B-60 (I think it's 9.25 oz.).  Taste is not full-bodied but rather ashy tasting and flat; it smells and tastes like cigarettes and coffee.<br />Also, I have to hold the machine closed while it's brewing.  The strange non-k-cup pod will not allow the machine to close properly.  The pods need to be stored in a ziploc or other airtight container.  I'd have appreciated knowing they were not standard k-cups in advance.<br />I won't re-order despite the savings."
negative,"I purchased this product because the pods looked like they were made in a more earth friendly way. There's no hard plastic cup involved. We break down our cups after use. We compost the coffee and recycle the foil tops. The plastic cups end up in the garbage.<br />This product arrives in several heavy plastic bags for freshness. The filter pods are synthetic so they can't be composted and the tops seem to be made of plastic, not foil. The only thing I can keep out of the garbage is the coffee itself.<br />The coffee tastes good."
positive,"I sort of like the built-in filter bag instead of the usual plastic container, and the plastic bag.  The taste, for me, is a little more bitter and less pleasant than the other French Roast coffees offered through Amazon."
positive,San Francisco Bay French Roast coffee has a great taste--full-bodied with no bitter aftertaste.  The K-cups appear to be more environmentally friendly than other K cups.
positive,San Francisco Bay French Roast coffee for keurig is one of the best k-cup coffee I have tried.  I recommend it to anyone who prefers the strong flavor of french roast coffee.
positive,"I was surprised when I saw the ""kups"", but I had nothing to be concerned about.  The little bags of coffee are very sturdy and the coffee is very good.  In fact the coffee is stronger than the other kups,  I much prefer these bags.  And monthly delivery is perfect."
positive,Ok so you know the pack is smaller... but dont get too dissapointed it is a strong cup of coffee  will make you go for a while befor you will want anther 1 i am a fan.
positive,"I was happy to see these new K-Cup designs because they're at a much better price point than the original K-Cups.  I tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee's French Roast because I like a really dark and flavorful cup of coffee.  Since I also almost always use the large cup setting when I brew my coffee, I want a coffee that gives as much flavor as possible.  I was not disappointed!  The French Roast has a very bold flavor while not being acidic or bitter.  I'll definitely be ordering more!"
negative,"This is a heads up for those who like strong, fresh, French Roast coffee... It will not be found with these K-Cups.<br /><br />Freshness. The coffee in each individual K-Cup is not sealed from air. While other brands have a plastic cup and a sealed top, the base on these Cups is the coffee filter. Secondly, all of the K-Cups are packaged together in a single plastic bag. Once that bag is opened, the unused K-Cups become exposed to air. I placed my remaining K-Cups in an sealed container.<br /><br />Coffee Quality. The taste is good but the strength is less than Starbucks French Roast. While the packaging indicates a very deep roast, I did not experience that strength. If a mild French Roast brew is desired, then this coffee should work fine."
positive,Different look but works just fine in my maker.  I love the French Roast flavor.  I will definitely buy again.
positive,Just tried this coffee a few days ago and love it!  I like my coffee strong (will enjoy a dopio every now and then).  This coffee is strong and smooth.  I can't ask for more.
positive,"Like many Keurig users, I have been frustrated by the lack of choices in K-cup vendors. That is, while there are many types of coffees available, only Green Mountain can make the K-cup because of their patent.  Pricing has been held fairly high and steady. It would be nice to have a choice and better pricing.<br /><br />The SF Bay coffee appears to be a good alternative. I have used it for 2 weeks and it seems to be compatible with the Keurig machine. The coffee taste is good. I prefer a stronger taste and am ok with it a bit more bitter. As a frame of reference, I find the average 7 oz cup too weak and use the 3 or 5oz setting.<br /><br />As others have noted, the coffee comes in small bags of 8 ""pods"" each. You have to put the open bag in a ziploc bag for storage because the coffee in the pods is exposed in the filter.<br /><br />I really like the price of the SF Bay coffee. It is good value and feel like I have a choice.<br /><br />I am not a SF Bay employee or shareholder. I just want reasonable pricing and choice."
positive,"We picked these up at our warehouse club store... They are under forty cents per cup. Delicious, dark roast. I love the fact that each k-cup has an exposed filter rather than the plastic cups. We will be sticking to these!"
positive,"I bought this at a local HEB in Texas for $6.99 and was skeptical but alas! this is great in my Platinum Keurig. I had decided not to use k cups anymore because the price is over the top but these will keep me going until Keurig prices come down! I brewed on the 10 oz setting and is VERY bold for me, I wwas even able to add more water through it because it was too bold for me. Love that it doesnt use all the plastic too..."
negative,"Coffee is fine.  But I won't buy again.  As another reviewer reported, this is not a standard K-Cup design.  Simply a paper filter below a plastic collar.  Shorter than a K-Cup, so doesn't come in contact with the bottom punch.  Water flows through the filter and into the cup . . . albeit at a faster rate than being forced through the small bottom hole of the standard K-Cup.  Do not attempt to brew a large cup, it will be too watery.<br /><br />Twelve servings come packed in a vacuum packed plastic bag.  When you open the bag, all twelve containers are exposed, so you'll need to repackage them in a zip-lock bag if you want to keep them fresh.  They do not fit in the standard K-Cup carousel."
negative,"This coffee was not as good and rich I hoped-leaves a bitter taste even when sugar is added.  Also when op;en the package containing pods, the coffee is exposed to the air-only has a filter around it so smells nice in the coffee drawer of your kitchen."
positive,I found the coffee to be a little to strong for my taste. Many times I had to let the pod<br />go a second time to get the coffee I like
positive,My husband is very fussy about his coffee and this one is the one he likes best.  Very robust taste.
positive,"I like these for a couple of reasons.  First, the coffee is very good.  I like a dark, rich roast and if I put this on the smallest setting for my Keurig brewer, I get a cup comparable to when I go to my favorite local coffee house.<br />Second, I like that they are little pouches rather than the k-cup - less plastic, less waste.  And I've never had one leak coffee grounds.<br />The one drawback, as some have commented is that they may go stale faster.  They are sold in boxes of 12 (Amazon sells you 3 of those boxes at a time), so as long as you just open one at a time and you finish the box within two weeks, it is not a concern - at least I have had no problem with staleness!<br />They are also less expensive with the Subscribe and Save - a win-win all around!"
positive,"This is great coffee! Delicious flavor,a little on the strong side for those who like it strong.Love the cups- no extra plastic that goes into the land fills!!! This is a great idea for a k-cup. Keep up the good work !!!!!!"
negative,"I bought this thinking it was a good deal, and I remember in my Keurig brewer's sampler pack that I like the french roast cups.  So, I ordered this ""deal"".  Do not buy this burnt, after-tasting, muddy coffee!!  Not worth the pennies saved."
negative,"sorry, but this coffee was a little too roasted for me, even thoughts of burnt coffee go through my mind.  I'm using it up, but not for fixing my friends a cup of coffee"
negative,"Being a huge fan of the ""subscribe and save"" program through Amazon, I decided to add coffee to an ever growing list of products delivered.  This coffee, however, is the worst my husband and I have ever tried!  Beware."
positive,THIS COFFEE TASTES GREAT BEST VALUE FOR KERIG SYSTEM ONE THING YOU MUST DO WITH THIS COFFEE AFTER UNPACKING IS PUT IT IN A PLASTIC BAG TO KEEP FRESH YOU MUST KEEP THE AIR OUT DONT PUT IT IN THE FRIGE KEEP IT ROOM TEMP IF YOU ARE A COFFEE EXPERT LIKE ME YOU WILL LOVE THIS COFFEE RICH FLAVOR ALL FLAVORS ARE GREAT EVEN THE DECAF YOU WILL SAVE AROUND 10 CENTS TO 12 CENTS PER POD LEAVE IT TO AMAZON TO BRING US THIS GREAT COFFEE I AM A PRIME MEMBER I SAVE ON SHIPPING AND HANDILING BECOME A PRIME MEMBER AND SAVE WAY TO GO AMAZON
negative,"This is the WORST coffee I have had in years.  Either they do not know what French Roast is or someone really messed up.  I put cream in my coffee so at least I can taste that.  Avoid this brew! Does not deserve any ""Stars"" because it cannot be coffee."
negative,I thought that this was a great idea for a K-Cup...still do...but after one cup we threw the rest of it away...oh my!
positive,"The Rogers Family Company continues to be a tremendous supporters of local schools. As Principal of Jefferson Elementary, I appreciate the kindness and generosity this company has shown us. A few years back they donated $10,000 to our school and most recently they provided our staff a one cup coffee maker and samples of these wonderful Keurig coffees. My favorite is the French Roast. Strong flavor with a smooth finish. Please support this company by purchasing their coffee."
negative,"This is without a doubt the worst coffee I ever tasted!  The only reason I ever tried a box of this coffee is that the ""wonderful"" people at Amazon canceled my subscribe and save item of Diedrich french roast.This coffee even smells horrible right out of the box."
negative,"Not going to mince many words on this terrible coffee.  It is substantially inferior to a K-cup or Solofill/My-K-Kup as it leaves a LOT of mud in the cup with your coffee.  It's over-roasted, having a burnt, ashtray-flavored quality.  Very disappointed with the product."
negative,I have never had coffee as bad as this. If you like bitter flavorless coffee maybe this is for you. I am very disappointed and would not buy it again at any price.
negative,"Save yourself from trying these k-cups - not a good substitute for the typical ones, like the ones from Green Mountain.  Bitter taste and unpleasant after taste as well.  Not worth it at all."
negative,"Gave them a try.<br /><br />It does brew a cup of coffee but not with the same quality taste as the K-Cup.<br /><br />The difference is not brewing the coffee in the K -Cup is evident in taste,<br /><br />It is a patent work around that for me is not worth what frankly is a trivial cost savings.<br /><br />Yes, sometimes quality matters."
negative,"This coffee is awful, very bitter, and I have had others taste it, my sister and my husband, its not drinkable. I wanted to return it, but its grocery, so I am stuck with it. Very disappointing. I bought it because it had good reviews and a great price."
negative,"these arent k-cups but can be used in a keurig and go stale, they are getting sued by gmcr for a patent violation"
negative,These Kcups?? were flimsy imitation want a bees and were not what I expected at all.  Very disappointed and will not fall for that again.  The coffee was weak and the containers split.  I threw them out after trying a couple.
negative,"I tried it when it arrived and did not like it. I tried to send the other unopened bags back but that request was was denied by Amazon. I tried to drink it when we ran out of our reg k-cups and we waiting on the new delivery, it was all I had in the house and I still could not drink it. I gave it all away. The man of house also could not drink it. If you order it for the price as I did, beware if you are somewhat spoiled by good coffee. I am a fan of most Starbucks products, although I am not crazy about the Starbucks k-cups. We have been drinking the Donut Shop K-cups forever. I also like Green Mountain breakfast blend. I spend over $50.00 a month just on Donut Shop K-cups."
negative,This was the most disappointing coffee I've gotten for the Kcup. The only way I was able to drink it was to add milk and chocolate syrup to it to cover the taste. Not good.
negative,"I love my k-cups and this is the worst I have ever tasted!  I thought most of the reviews sound good....so give it a chance...after a few sips, I threw the entire 36 cups into the trash! Don't listen to the rave reviews...stick to brands you already know and love!"
negative,"The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly. But even if used quickly they are weak and watery. Actually, more like dishwater. They should come with a warning label. I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design."
negative,Open air cups - not a good idea. Better off with real K cups.  Open air cups - not a good idea. Better off with real K cups.
positive,I could smell the aroma of this french roast coffee when I took off the plastic covering the box.  It smelled wonderful.<br />It was just as good when brewed.<br />I like that the pods are not solid plastic and take up less room in the trash and hopefully less room in the landfill.<br />Good product.
positive,This is a great coffee. Dark and smoky without being bitter. Combine great taste with a great price and you really have a winner!  The decaf is really good too!
positive,"These pods work great.  I usually drink emerals, double black diamond, and recently newmans.  All of these are extra bold and dark. I brew 10oz.  I was concerned about weak coffee body and flavor.  These cups are definitely worth trying.  You won't be disappointed.  The 10oz came out great!"
positive,"A good, strong French Roast with a smooth mouthfeel and no bitter finish. Definitely planning to try San Francisco Bay's other products. I love how much less plastic is wasted. (My Keurig is my best friend, but there's so much waste in most disposable K-Cups!)"
positive,"I have been using kcups for a few years now and recently discovered these. I was sceptical but decided to try the SF Bay French Roast, Fog Chaser and Rainforest blends. I generally like strong, dark blends like emerils or dark magic. Overall, all 3 of the SF Bay blends are really good. The French Roast is my favorite though. It is strong and has a rich flavor and is not bitter. The fog chaser is STRONG and a bit bitter. The Rainforest is a bit less strong and has a slight bitterness. All are good strong blends but I like the richness of the French Roast. Overall these are really good and are much cheaper than ""traditional"" kcups which is an added bonus."
positive,better for the environment with less packaging and by far the best priced keurig cup now. Costco is 8 dollars cheaper though on the 80 pack
positive,"I was fascinated by the description of these new K-cups and decided to take a chance after reading the reviews.  I am very pleasantly surprised at the wonderfully flavorful coffee that they made!  I am very particular about my coffee and like only very dark flavorful roasts.  I had not really been pleased with any of the K-cups--some of course were better than others--and had pretty much settled on Starbucks Verona as my favorite, but these are better!  (And--MUCH less expensive!)<br />My Keurig Platinum is at my beach home (only weekend usage and not every weekend at that!) so I was a bit concerned about this style K-cup staying fresh once the individual bag was opened.  A bag ended up staying very fresh for several weeks--of course I resealed the bag with a couple of clips as well as I could--so this is no longer a concern of mine.  I will be a regular consumer!"
positive,"This is decidedly the best K-cup coffe I ever had. Before I tried this one, my k-cup carousel was a multi-colored mess with samples from variety of k-cups; from green mtn breakfast blend (just OK) to Emeril's dark roast (fairly decent) to Kona blend (terrible). Now with SF Bay french roast, I dont even need the carousel. These cups stay fresh in their original packaging. The taste is just the way I like it - strong but not bitter. Just a great coffee."
negative,"Bought this because it was suggested to me via email from Amazon.  So disappointed!  I love bold, dark coffees (French Roast from Tully's, Green Mountain, etc), but this tastes like an ash tray.<br /><br />Gave it two stars because the more environmentally friendly design is clever.  Otherwise, it would have been one star for sure."
positive,"Robust, full-bodied and delightful. If you like deep, rich complex coffee, this is the perfect blend for you! Appreciate the reduced eco-friendly packaging too. Added to my Subscribe & Save account."
positive,"I bought this coffee without reading through the description thoroughly, so when they arrived minus the plastic cup I was used to I was shocked and ready to send them back.  But I decided to give them a try and I have to say that there is no difference between these and the regular Kcups.  The coffee is rich and full bodied and I like the fact that they are a little more environmentally friendly that the regular plastic cups.  I will and actually have ordered them again.  I normally use my adapter for my bagged coffee, but when I am in a hurry (or for my husband who would rather not fool with the adapter) I use the occasional K cup, or this kind now that I have tried them!"
positive,"I will start off saying i'm not a coffee snob, but I think these are great. For the price they can't be beat- and we keep them in a mason jar on the counter (so cute!) to keep  them fresh. my husband also said they are easier to prepare to go into the compost pile.<br />Any reservations on this, please order them and try! what will you be out? with ship and save only $13.50."
positive,"Bought a Keurig last year but have struggled to find decent coffee.  We finally resorted to the little refillable thing but it was a mess and a hassle.  We've always enjoyed SF Bay Coffee and these pods are wonderful.  The quality of the coffee is SO much better than anything else we've tried.  Not sure about those negative reviews--nothing watery or dishwatery about the cups we are brewing.  I like the packaging much better as well, I don't want things I consume touching all that plastic that is getting heated up.  The French Roast is perfect in the morning and the Rainforest Blend is wonderful too.  The Company has also made a big commitment to the communities where their coffee is grown, including fair trade and sustainable ventures."
positive,"I found that not only was keeping these pods fresh by keeping them in zip locks bags a pain, but that this roast was really too bold for me.<br />I can't get anyone at home or work to drink these.<br />I will stick with Green Mountain Nantucket blend in the future."
positive,"Please see my complete review for all the San Francisco blends under the Rainforest blend.  Except I forgot to mention the Fog Lifter<br />I would put in the little lighter than this French Roast, which I believe is the best Bold I have tried.<br />San Francisco Brand is the only K-cup brand we purchase now that we have found all the PLUSES!"
positive,"The trouble I find with a lot of the Kuerig cups is that I like my coffee strong and most cups aren't strong enough if I want a full cup of coffee without using two cups at a lower volume. With these, I get the strength I want with just one."
negative,"The concept for packaging this coffee was great.  Simply putting the coffees in a ziploc bag preserved their freshness and the idea that I was putting less plastic in our local landfill was great as I live in a little village on the Yukon River.<br /><br />However, I found this roast to have a very bitter aftertaste.  I generally enjoy a full, dark roast and I like the bitterness of coffee.  That's the whole point.  But I was really unhappy with the finish in this particular French Roast and won't purchase it again.  I am slowly working my way through the 80 count I bought, on days when I have a taste for added creamer flavors.  This isn't a comment on any of the other San Fransisco Bay products, as I haven't tried them, just this particular roast."
positive,"I love the fact that this delicious, strong K-cup ready coffee comes with an exposed filter.  I'd been trying to cut the bottoms off of the K-cups I had been using, in order to recycle them. (good intentions, but not realistic!) The fact that they don't even have the bottom portion of the ""regular"" K-cups while still maintaining excellent, rich flavor makes me a convert.<br /><br />This flavor, French Roast, is bold, strong and just what I'm looking for as a morning coffee, and holds up very well as iced coffee as well.<br /><br />I'll be buying many more of these!"
positive,"Coffee is bold and very good. I like it better than Newman s and Folgers K-Cups. It is a bargain for the price. Also it is great that the ""cups"" are not plastic but just a filter :)My favorite k-kup for sure!"
positive,I tried these alternative k-cups for the first time and thought they were pretty good. I don't think I'll be buying the traditional k-cups again. The French Roast were nice and dark roasted.<br /><br />My 80-pack came with 10 bags of 8 pods. When I opened a bag I put the ones I wasn't going to use right then in a ziplock bag. Not much hassle to save 50% on the cost of k-cups.
positive,"After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the Fog Chaser. Here's my take on the French Roast after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer this to the Fog Chaser, but I like a darker roast.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is bold, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like really dark roasts but most people don't.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine."
positive,Love this coffee and love the price!I love the smell when I open the container and it is my new favorite coffee. I would recommend this to anyone. I keep it in a zip lock bag after opening to keep it fresh until used.
positive,"I did not buy these from Amazon, but apparently will in the future.  I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.  Since it's very easy to return stuff there, I bought it.  As others have commented, it's unusual looking, in that just the familiar looking K-Cup ring and foil at the top are there.  The plastic cup around the bottom is missing.  But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.  I went back to the store a few days later and they had sold out and they are not sure of plans to get more, so it looks like I will continue to buy my coffee from Amazon, but instead of my usuall brand (Green Mountain French Roast), I will be buying these."
positive,"These K-Cups arrived promptly after ordering; the are convenient to use, and the coffee tastes great. Highly recommend the product. Have had no problems."
positive,"This has become our daily coffee. We were previously Starbucks (brewed at home) coffee drinkers, although I will say these are not quite as strong as Starbucks brewed coffee...not weak either though. I usually buy them at our local wholesale warehouse, where the price is a little better, but I come to Amazon when I am needing it fast and don't have time to go to the store. It makes a good cup of coffee, that I happily serve to guests. The only down side is that the individual packaging does not allow for display. Not a big deal."
positive,"The coffee is very good.  The cup looks different than the standard k-cup but who care as long as the coffee is good and cost effective. With monthly subscription,  it saves me about $10 a month for regular drinking for 1 person.  Do the math if you have more people drinking.  Recommend the coffee and subscription"
positive,"We purchase on Subscribe and Save, 3 boxes a month.  I like the little filters instead of the pods. The price is great. My husband thinks the coffee is stronger than our previous French Roast.  However I really like the robust flavor and, at this price, he just adds a little more cream.  If this had resealable bag I would give four stars. We had to buy a large airtight jar."
positive,I like this coffee and the design of the cup. Not the same as a K-cup but works just as good. I like the Fog Chaser better than the French Roast but this is a pretty good tasting one too. Can't beat the price..15.99 for 36 is much cheaper than any other on Amazon.
positive,"I was surprised when I got these from Amazon because like the other reviewers said, the cups do not look like traditional K-Cups, because the bottom of the cup is a filter - not plastic like the traditional ones. But don't let this bother you - they worked just fine.<br /><br />The coffee was better than most - strong flavor. One of the better stronger brews.<br /><br />The only issue I see is that after you open the package, you must use the cups quickly or they will get stale. Some people like the K-Cups because they don't use that much coffee and so it is always fresh. But if you are like me and drink a lot of coffee, I don't see how you can go wrong with this coffee."
positive,"I'm a coffee lover and enjoy all kinds but now drink k-cup most of time.<br /><br />This one is really tasty French roast, better than any other French roast.<br />It's packed a bit different shaped container, but usage is same with other K-cups.<br />Also it smells good too and the rich taste remains in the mouth longer.<br />Price is also good comapred to other K-cups.<br /><br />One problem is it has too much of black resides at the bottom of cup.<br />Good taste all the way but at the end I have to be careful not to drink residues. It definitely needs improvement for filtration.<br />Due to too much remnants, I would not buy this again."
positive,"This coffee had all the rich flavor that I expect from a dark roast and minimal bitterness.  I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price."
positive,"Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer) which makes only a small cup.<br /><br />Less waste: We were really disappointed when we discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable. These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store. I buy k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them! Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Amazing!  I love a good dark French roast, and these are the best I've ever had.  Dark & rich but not bitter.  In fact, this morning I forgot to pour the creamer before I took a sip and I was amazed that it tasted really great.  I've tried to go without creamer before - I'd like to get used to coffee without it - but could never stand to...until I did it by mistake this morning and it was so smooth I drank the whole cup that way.  Trust me, this speaks volumes.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription, and I just increased the frequency of my deliveries because we found we drink these more than the regular k-cups. How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?"
positive,"This coffee is very good, it has a nice aroma and a good strong flavor.<br /><br />I also like the ""minimalist"" k-cup design, but have a couple complaints with it.  Since the individual pods aren't sealed, you have to keep them in a sealed package to prevent spoilage.  It would have been nice if the plastic bag they came in was re-sealable.<br />Also, since the coffee doesn't just come out of a small hole in the bottom of the pod, the first cup you make with these will wash all the stray grounds out of your machine and into your cup.  Be forewarned that you should wash the pod holder before using these.<br /><br />Overall I like the product, just be careful about the different pod shape."
positive,"This hot sauce is not to overwhelming and has a nice garlicky flavor to it. Awesome taste or the Moruga in there, this hot sauce is liquidy so it had the dot plastic thingy in the middle. I put it on everything and i would definitely order more."
negative,"This is way too sweet and artificially fizzy.  Somehow the pasturization process took out the goodness of the real Kombuchas. I've found that GT's Synergy is one of the best.  It also contains raw Chia, an outstanding energy food. Watch out for others, like this Wonder Drink, that try to use the same words and imitate the quality companies that produce Kombucha the way it is meant to be drank. Find one of the GT's Kombucha products and compare for yourself."
negative,"This drink is tasty and made with some pretty simple and natural ingredients. However, carbonation is added (in true kombucha it is a natural part of fermentation) and the drink is obviously pasteurized, which destroys any live culture (and thusly the probiotics that make kombucha popular as a health drink)."
positive,Very good  and arrived on time.  I will order this product again for me and my husband's use.  Very health product too.
negative,"First, this is a poor-tasting kombucha.  Worse, ""Wonder Drink"" Pasteurizes all of their products, eliminating any live cultures and therefore much of the reason to drink kombucha in the first place.  I do not recommend this product, and hope that Amazon carries a real kombucha in the future."
positive,"This product exceeded expectation, makes you feel better after drinking.  Will buy again.  Thank you Dr. Oz for talking about it on your show!"
positive,"Although possibly not a true Kombucha, although I am not a pro on the subject, the taste is great.  I have had the hard core kombucha and it took some getting use to, but filled with probiotics and other essentials.  This is a good introduction to the whole kombucha thing.  I'd probably read up to see just how valuable it is compared to other kombuchas.  Price is fair and shipping was relatively fast."
negative,I DID NOT LIKE IT. IT MADE ME COUGH EVERY DRINK OF IT & DID NOT TASTE GOOD I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT...
negative,"Do Not Buy!<br />I bought this case of 12 bottles 2 months ago and have consumed a few of them. At first I noticed that the bottle looked different than the ones I've seen before. The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two, no question they are not the same. I cannot return this item and I have used a few bottles. I would not buy again and I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />One note, I purchased this product through Amazon but Sold by: J&M Goods, LLC<br />Not sure if that makes any difference now you can buy direct."
negative,Got a 6 ounce bag at Wal-Mart for about two bucks.  Stands to reason you can get a quantity for a big discount?  Just look at the price of these seeds.  Way too much money.  No thank you.  Nutsonline has got better deals.
positive,"These roasted little gems are a must have if you are on a low carbohydrate diet, or if you just want a snack that won't spike your blood sugar but still is nice and crunchy and satisfying.  I tried the salted version but I am tempted now to try some of their other flavors."
positive,"These are better than the other brands I have tried. Most have an ingredients list along the lines of ""Pumpkin seeds, salt, (maybe some kind of oil)"" and that's it, and usually taste as bland as paper to me. I like salt, nay...I love salt. These have a nice roasted flavor, and salt you can actually taste. They are not overly salty tasting, you don't feel the salt on your fingers, and there isn't a layer of salt in the bottom of the bag like you see in a bag of pretzels. It was nice not to have to get out the salt shaker and dump some in the bag.<br /><br />I wound  up eating nearly a whole bag in one sitting. If you like nuts and seeds, and enjoy a tasty salty snack then you will most definetly like these."
positive,"I love this peanut butter, but suprise suprise, so do my kids!  I have always bought the large container of the jiffy/skippy brands from costco, but wanted to get away from the hydrongenated oils and excessive sugar.  I still wanted it to taste good, be smooth and not seperate like the high end organic food stores.  This is a great alternative, and I feel better feeding it to my kids."
positive,"Very happy with the quality and value of this peanut butter.  I dont really like that there is sugar added, but at least its not corn syrup or trans fat."
positive,"I love that this is a no-stir natural peanut butter. It has no trans fats and no cholesterol, no hydrogenated oil and no high fructose corn syrup. What I didn't expect was the extra sweetness provided by the evaporated cane juice and palm fruit oil. I prefer pure, ground peanuts. Nevertheless, I would purchase this again. I think children would probably prefer it over natural, oily p.b. too."
positive,"We love this PB! its the best out there, and we order this online be cause it is often out of stock at our local grocery."
positive,"I love, love this PB!! Its so smooth and taste so good don't even need jelly with it its so good!"
negative,"I don't know about you, but when I go looking for a product that explicitly states it has no added sugar, I mean sugar in the general, anything-that-is-chemically-sugar sense.  These folks make the ""no added sugar"" claim, and then follow it up with (oh by the way) ""a little bit of cane juice for sweetness.""  Which is to say, added sugar.  3 grams per serving, in fact, if my online search for this product's nutritional information is correct.<br /><br />Who are these people, unemployed politicians?<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Fifty50 brand.  Not only are they not lying through their teeth about not adding sugar, but they also donate half their profits to Diabetes research."
positive,"The place where I get most of my essential oils from has started to sell these Himalayan salt diffusers. They had little jars filled with olive size pink salt and you pour the oil over them, close the lid when not in use. I thought I could do that myself. I found these on Amazon, just what I was looking for. Perfect size and price.  The salt does not influence the fragrance of the oils at all, the perfect diffuser. I even will smash some with a hammer for my salt grinder. Spice Lab shipped it out quickly, very happy with the product and Spice Lab."
positive,"The flavors in the chocolates are only outdone by their beauty. They a soo good! I know the chef, he trained in Switzerland to learn how to make these, and you can tell. They melt in your mouth and rival any ""name brand"" out there."
positive,"I have loved chocolate my whole life and have sought out many types.  This chocolate is smooth, creamy and delicious.  It's hard to put the box down.  I am spoiled for other chcolates!! I highly recomend them to others."
positive,"I have English Cocker Spaniels who are allergic to grain. These are GREAT! I have ordered them before and never seem to have enough. My dogs are VERY happy campers. Healthy ingredients and taste good too! They will obey any command I request when they know these treats are available. Wet tongues and wiggle bodies make my heartstrings sing!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R13LA6"">Northern Biscuit Grain-Free Honey Glazed Duck w/ Real Papaya Dog Treat</a>"
negative,"Is this for 10LB Case of Jelly Belly Tutti Frutti Jelly Beans or is this for what the picture shows ""Baby Flash Pop""... Please change picture or description, very misleading... thank you."
positive,"My wife and I used to eat these all the time back when I lived in Central Illinois. Strangely, when I moved to Chicagoland, we couldn't find them any more. So, I was thrilled to discover I could get them from Amazon.<br /><br />These are incredibly tasty. And, unlike many other brands, they are free of trans fats. My only criticism is that they're a bit more fragile than some other brands, especially after heating them in the over per the package directions. You have to be careful biting into them to prevent your entire taco from falling apart. If they were a bit more robust, I'd give them 5 stars.<br /><br />One thing to note: being preservative-free, they have a relatively short shelf life. The case I got from Amazon had a ""best by"" date about 3 months in the future. So, before ordering 12 boxes, make sure that you can go through at least a box per week."
positive,"This was the best $18.00 I ever spent on a box.  I ate that box so fast I was dizzy.  I was skeptical about ordering a box online but there wasn't anything too fishy about this one so I just went to town on it.  I spilled some on the carpet but the dog came over to clean it up.  Whoah, Sparky! That's for me!"
positive,"Amara is a great product.  It tastes delicious, not fruity and is lo cal.  A perfect beverage after working out.  Red Bull and Monster are so heavy...like a weight in your stomach.  Amara is a refreshing recovery beverage.  Who wants to fill full after a workout?  Not me!"
positive,I have never really liked the taste of redbull or monster (too weird and tangy) but Amara is delicious. It has great flavor with just enough kick to keep you moving.  I drink it solo and have also used it as a mixer - goes great with vodka.  Will definitely order more.
negative,"A great disappointment.  Having read about the excellence of vintage Pernod products, I was eager to try their modern concoction.<br /><br />What a fall from Grace!  Not only the green color of the drink is obviously artificial; when louched, the potent green is still present, making the final product greenish instead of the white it should be.  You can only taste a strong anise flavor, and a burning sensation when you are finished.  No hint of wormwood at all!<br /><br />I would not recommend this absinthe even to beginners.  Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether."
negative,"Ok, so 24 16.9 oz bottles for $49.95. I pay $0.88 or $1.25 for my 2 liter bottle (depending on the promotions). Therefore, 24 x 16.9 oz bottles cost only around $11-$15."
positive,"This is one food that when mixed with their dry food, my dogs will eat every last drop. They love this. Our older dog (just turned 2) needs to be on a grain free diet, so that is what our puppy gets too. I love that this is 95% Turkey and that the dogs really like it."
positive,"My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine."
positive,"I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only ""dog foods"" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend."
positive,"My pups LOVE this food!  WELLNESS products have consistently proven to be top of the line food for dogs and cats and their Chicken Stew is no exception!<br />This is so well made and although the sauce is kinda slimy, it is a healthy slimy and one that nourishes my dearest of creatures!  Please note that this food is not meant as a dish all unto itself, but rather, it is a food topper to go with dry food nuggets.  Together the nutrition abounds!"
positive,I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.
positive,"The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.  I highly recommend this product!"
negative,I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.
positive,WE FOUND THIS DOG FOOD ONLINE AND COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT IT WAS 95% BEEF WITH NO FILLERS! THIS IS HARD TO BEAT FOR PET FOOD. OUR GUYS LOVE THIS FOOD AND IT IS NICE TO KNOW IT ISN'T FILLED WITH JUNK. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOOD.
positive,I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.
positive,"Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand ""Beef Stew"" and Wellness brand ""Lamb and Beef Stew"", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy."
positive,"I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it."
positive,"I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever."
positive,My dogs and I love this food. They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them. I mix it up with the Wellness Super 5 mix.
positive,"My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.  Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never."
positive,"This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem."
positive,"As a newly adopter of a one year old, I tried certain foods with not much success.  My dog loves this food, and I do too, as she eats well and healthy."
positive,"My two dogs love Wellness brand dog food.  It's expensive but I just feel I'm doing the right thing for them with food I think is probably good really meaty food. They have begin to turn away from Newmans and I sure don't trust Alpo since the Chinese dogfood scare, but the various Wellness products are the best I can do for my little (and quite big) best friends."
positive,I have been buying this food locally but began to have a hard time fInding it. I searched online and it was a little more cost effective. My pups seem to love this food.
positive,"this food is great but I suggest you just buy one can first, too make sure your dog likes it. (because it is expensive, but... your dog is worth it"
positive,"It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products."
positive,"I just wanted to supplement the dry food that I feed my two schnauzers. I tried several other brands and even other canned food by this same brand. My dogs did not do well on any of them until I tried this one. They love it and it does not cause stomach upset or potty problems. I highly recommend this product for extra protein, esspecialy if your dog has a delicate system."
positive,"Since putting our dog on the Wellness dog food, we don't have any more diarrhea or upset tummy issues."
positive,"My puppy had a severe diarrhea for weeks until we put her on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato.  Just like a miracle, she is healthy and energetic."
positive,"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet."
positive,"I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach."
positive,"I was able to add a full pound to my skinny, 15yr old toy poodle with this.  He loves it and looks forward to dinner again.  I'd order it through Amazon, but it's only one cent cheaper on Amazon than it is in the pet store."
positive,I'll be returning this product.  Half the cans were dented and the lables were falling off.  I tried one can that wasn't dented - my dogs were not impressed.
positive,"I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit. The other was very hesitant and didn't finish it. I won't buy this again."
positive,"Product was priced fairly; delivery was fast and affordable.  If you have ever had Heinz India Relish, this is exactly like it, which is different than most other pickle relishes--I think it is made with sweet pickles and bread-and-butter pickles.  Mix this relish with fresh or canned corn and a little onion and bell pepper, and you have the perfect Corn Relish for a summer side-dish.  Delicious."
positive,"Ok, let's be honest. ""Dogs will be dogs"" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're ""guilt-free""; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them ""junk food"", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit."
positive,"Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be broken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!"
negative,"I ordered this company's French Roast and it was awesome. The mesh cups are great, the flavor bold and rich. I should have stuck with the French Roast.  I was sadly dissapointed in Fogchaser. It was actually bland, nothing bold about it.  Either there was something wrong with the coffee or it is just plain weak.  I will reorder the French Roast and give the other 46 cups of Fogchaser to my 87 year old Father-in-law who likes his coffee mild."
positive,"I LOVE STRONG COFFEE AND ALMOST ALLWAYS USED ""NEWMANS OWN"" BUT I DECIDED TO TRY THESE BASED ON THE REVIEWS AND THE GREAT PRICE. WHAT A GREAT MOVE THIS TURNED OUT TO BE INCREDABLE COFFEE ,SMOOTH ,GREAT PRICE ,AND LESS PLASTIC. SO GOOD THAT I STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION,CHANGED TO INCREASE THE QUANTIY,AND NOW HAD TO ORDER A EXTRA SHIPMENT."
positive,Loved the design of these. They fit perfectly in the Keurig brewer. Less plastic and great taste. Have not had any mishaps and no coffee grounds as you can sometimes get with regular Kcups.
positive,"I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this coffee is. I have ordered several of their flavors on Subscribe and Save. Can't beat the price and they are all very good tasting coffee.<br />The pods are different but it is not an issue for me. I don't store them in my carrousel as I am afraid they would get ""stale"" but instead store them in a ziplock bag in the cabinet. This works great.<br />I like them all and wish San Fransisco Bay would come out with more flavors."
positive,"We were alittle hesitant at first, but love them! Everyone we have offered a cup to are also in love... will continue to purchase as long as the price remains almost unbeatable."
positive,Much less plastic for the environment - way to go.. finally.. just imagine all the plastic cups from everones coffee floating around. I will report back once tasted... the reviews look great. Im game.
positive,"This Fog Chaser was available at my local grocery store. I thought I would give it a try. Well let me tell you, even on the highest setting this cup is STRONG. Reminds me of a regular pot of Dark Communittee Coffee. If you think the regular k-cups are just too weak, give this a try and you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, ""the VUE""  that uses different and patented cups."
positive,"I always try my coffee straight black with no cream or sugar the first time. I did not care much for it in that form. Once I put creamer and sugar in though, it is a really good cuppa joe. I probably won't be ordering again since I don't always have cream/sugar available, but I think it is still a solid 4 star since it is so good when properly doctored up."
positive,"We love this coffee!  Its delicious and bold, just like we like our coffee.  Its great to be able to get this quality of coffee at such a great price too!"
positive,Great coffee for someone who likes a stronger flavor. Small package that really packs a punch - I've had more expensive coffees and really prefer this one!
positive,"One of my biggest pet peeves is over-packaging, so I gave the ""frustration free"" pods a shot. I like that there's less waste to dump in landfills. However, the pods don't work well in my Keurig. In order to brew, I have to push down on the handle until the cycle is done, otherwise, nothing happens. I really like the flavor of the coffee, but keeping it fresh is an issue, even though I store the pods in air-tight containers. I probably won't buy coffee packaged this way in the future."
positive,awesome coffee at an affordable price. delivered to my door at no cost to me.  makes having a keirig brewer even better.
positive,This flavor is my favorite so far. The price isn't bad either.I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a smooth cup of coffee.
positive,If you are a real coffee drinker you will love this brew.  It is fairly stong but I feel that all coffees should be strong.  The flavor is smooth and there is no bitter aftertase.  Try it and you won't be sorry!  It is now my favorite.
positive,"This is an original way to produce a K-Cup, it works very well.  The coffee is good overall, and GREAT for the PRICE.  Signing up for AutoDelivery gets you a price per serving that cannot be touched in the K-Cup universe.  Big whoop, so you have to store the unused balance of the dozen per bag in a ziplock bag ---> for several dollars per box I can handle that!"
positive,me: Normally drink Rainforest Espresso<br /><br />Tried this due to the price and less plastic.<br /><br />Like it a lot.<br /><br />Very good and love the concept but wish they shipped in a resealable bag or container.
positive,"I bought these ""kcups"" to save money as the cost on my usual Kcups rose to 51 cents a cup on subscribe and save and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else online or locally. These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a ""Kcup""!! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6"">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>"
positive,"This is my new favorite ""k-cup"" (it's not a k-cup but it fits in all Keurig machines)! It's very strong, but not bitter or burnt--it's just plain great coffee.  I wish I had invented this cheaper version of a k-cup, because this design is genius.  Out of 15 of my cups of this coffee so far, only one had a coffee ground in it--just one little piece.<br /><br />This is best with just cream, it's just plain luxurious!  Thanks SF Bay Coffee!"
positive,"I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste."
positive,"Had to try this as soon as I received it. Made a great bold cup of coffee. Was very impressed  with the ""pod"". Very little waste, as compared to the regular k-cups. I will be trying different flavors in the future."
negative,I like the idea like most people and saw many good reviews to believe that the coffee will actually taste good.<br />Nope. The taste is terrible and no aroma. The quality of the coffee bean selection need to be improved.<br />Disappointed with my first try of  san francisco bay kcup coffee.
negative,"I purchased this after reading the mostly quite positive reviews which equated its taste with Jet Fuel and other bold flavors.  My first cup (medium setting) was off-putting at best. I brewed my second cup on the small-cup setting, hoping for a bolder and richer flavour and mouth feel; none was forthcoming. I appreciate the less plastic packaging and don't find it a bad flavor - I personally don't find the intense boodness I look forward to in a cup of coffee."
positive,This is very tasty coffee and a bit cheaper than Keurig-sanctioned k-cups. The pod packaging is minimal.  I agree there is very little waste.  The top looks like a typical k-cup and the bottom looks like a filter.  You will want some sort of tupperware or jar to store the onecups once you open the pouch they come in since they will be exposed somewhat to air and lose freshness otherwise.  I just use a spare ice cream tub and dump the open bag in there.  Perfect!<br /><br />Today I made myself a larger cup than usual by accident and it was still rich and delicious.<br /><br />I usually drink the Newman's own coffee that I buy at Costco to give you an idea of my tastes.  I think this is better.
positive,"I love the convenience of K cups but I don't love the waste so I was looking for an alternative. I've already tried the reusable substitutes but I could never get the right grind of coffee beans to produce the coffee flavor/robustness that I like. This coffee is a great bargain for the price, especially with the Subscribe and Save. It is not my absolute favorite, I still prefer Newman's Own blend, but it is better tasting to me than other K Cup offerings(the Folgers blends for example).  I hope San Francisco Bay comes out with more dark/bold roasts because I would definitely try them."
positive,"Nice cup of coffee, I'm not a tree-hugger, but if you are, you will appreciate that it only has a plastic ring/top as opposed to the normal whole plastic k-cup.  I tried it because it is a little cheaper, but still convenient, with the rising cost of coffee (and everything else) compared to grinding yourself and using the ekcobrew (which works much better than the standard k-cup self grind accessory, but is still a bit of a hassle with clean up).  We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).  Overall a nice strong cup that is smooth, with less hassle than self grind and fairly cheap (even cheaper with subscribe and save)"
positive,This is great coffee at a great price!  I'm very happy with my purchase and will purchase more in the future.  Yummy.
positive,"While some products like the ""My K-Cup"" don't work in all brewers, the Rogers ""One Cup"" products are more compatible.  They work just fine in the Keurig B-3000, which is a large brewer aimed at the office market.  Sometimes you may get the ""no K-cup detected"" warning, but you can ignore it.<br /><br />It's great to have an alternative to the Green Mountain products."
positive,"The container is better for the environment and the coffee is very good.  I have tried Fog Chaser, French Roast and Rainforest Blend.  All are very good."
positive,"I ordered a box based on the reviews and I must say I am somewhat dissapointed. If you enjoy a full flavored medium roast you'll enjoy this one. It has complex flavors and a smooth finish.<br />That said, it's definitely not full bodied or bold in flavor. My favorite k-cups are Coffee People Organic, Newman's Special Blend Organic, Emril's Big Easy Bold and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso. If you like deep bold coffee flavor this one comes up short."
positive,"SF Bay Coffee One Cup is a great option. I felt the coffee was stronger, or less watery, than most k-cups, and the price is a big savings.  It comes with 12 in one sealed bag, so I rolled the bag up tightly between uses and used them up within a few days. Not a good choice if you want lots of variety."
positive,"While the container that goes into the brewer looks odd it seems to work well.  The coffee arrived in a box with three individual bags of 12 ""pods"".  I used the first two of these this morning and did not have any problems with the brewing.  They seemed to work just fine.  I liked the strong robust flavor of the coffee."
positive,"I am pleased with this brand of coffee, great flavor and no waste with the great design. Will be one of my favorite blends now."
negative,"This coffee tastes like a good cup of gas station or fast food coffee (i.e., objectively average, at best).  It is not very flavorful, particularly compared to other k-cup brands on the market.  But, this coffee is also 30-50% less expensive per cup.<br /><br />It's also worth noting (as other reviewers have) that these need to be kept in an air-tight container because they are not individually sealed; the bottoms of each cup are semipermeable filters--not air tight plastic like other k-kups.  This is inconvenient if you prefer to keep your k-cups in a k-cup tower next to the machine."
positive,"The only reason I won't give the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser a 5 star, is that once you open the sealed bag the coffee doesn't stay fresh for very long. I enjoyed the coffee, had great aroma and love that it's packaging is reduced plastic compared to original Kcups. The main thing I loved was the price! Just figure out a way to retain freshness and it's gold!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
positive,Coffee was not as strong or fresh tasting as I like. Some of the pods were damaged in the package causing a coffee grounds mess for the rest of the package of pods.
negative,"Overall its just OK when considering the price of other K-cups.  The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.  The lack of the plastic housing around the coffee filter, in my opinion, causes the water to flow thru the coffee too quickly and contributes to a weak flavor.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy these again."
positive,"I like my coffee to have a bold eye opening taste. This Fog Chaser is very good. Great taste and the way they are made is much more environmentally friendly. The price is very good on them also. I have them on a monthly subscription and save even more money. Thank you for having this top quality item..<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
positive,Fog Chaser is my new favorite single-cup coffee. Love it. The fact that it's less expensive per cup than any other brand/variety I've tried (especially from this vendor) is a huge bonus.
positive,When you open the sealed inner bag and this amazing aroma of coffee grabs you and you just can't wait to brew a cup and try it.  This coffee definitely had me at hello... and I knew it was a keeper when I served to guests and they exclaimed that it was the best cup of coffee that they have ever had. I just wish that it was available on subscribe and save like the other San Francisco Bay coffees.  I also really like the environmentally friendly pod.  I think the new packaging works even better than the all plastic cups.<br /><br />***Modified February 2012<br />Yeah!  This coffee is now available on subscribe and save!
positive,"Received this yesterday and was quite surprised how good the taste was. I have bought this brand before in the bean version at costco and it was good.  The coffee was bold and smooth. Had less waste than a regular k-cup. Since the pod  below doesnt have a shell, I suggest once the plastic is opened, place them in an airtight container until used. I'd recommend consuming the 12 pack with a few days to a week.  Can't wait to try the other versions of this coffee. I will buy again."
positive,"San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is a very nice complement to the Keurig Green Mountain selections.  I am now on my computer with a nice hot cup of the Fog Chaser at my side. I like the fact that there are eight cups to an air tight bag, and that there is an external plastic container for storage after you open one of these bags. A very nice option which I will again use for future purchases."
positive,"This coffee has a full body and a rich taste. The price is far below the ""other"" coffee in the K cup and does not use as much plastic."
positive,"This coffee is exceptional and always consistent. I say to myself daily ""Wow, this is an amazing cup of coffee"" I will purchase this product many times over."
positive,"The San Francisco Bay coffee in the 36 count is a very cost effective way to get coffee for a Keurig machine.  I am serving in Afghanistan and it was in my hands 5 days after ordering!  I could not be more pleased with the coffee package value and the Fog Chaser blend is a bold, yet low acidic flavor.  I highly recommend it!"
positive,"As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good."
positive,"Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot.  I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel."
positive,"This coffee is great in my Keurig and alot more reasonably priced here at Amazon. Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups. The taste is great, bold and deep mellow flavor, this is my new coffee for sure."
positive,"Yes, it's hard to get used to the different design of these (paper-filter bottom), but they work fine in my Keurig Platinum B-70 and have enough coffee to make a bold, 10-oz cup.<br /><br />The flavor of ""Fog Chaser"" is strong and complex -- it took me a few days to get used to it, but now it is one of my favorites (tied with Timothy's Midnight Magic).<br /><br />I'm so glad that the patent on K-cups has expired so we can have some new companies making them, producing great products at lower price.  Hooray for the free market! (smile)"
negative,We threw this away. It is the very worse coffee I have ever bought. Undrinkable. Their french roast is much better.
positive,Fog chaser was the best both in flavor and body.  So far this is the only product that the body is compatible to the richer flavor of blew coffee that uses k-cup system.
negative,"When I first got the pods I loved them but after a couple of weeks in opened or unopened packages these pods must have lost their freshness because the coffee does is just not the same and it's pretty much awful at this point, I am sorry I went ahead and purchased 160 more pods after the first 36 because now I'm stuck with them and I can't stomach them nor can anyone in my family."
positive,"Its about time some one came up with a viable alternative to the more expensive coffee single cup brewers. this is a great product, its not Star bucks, but it works."
positive,"It takes trying a few other brands of coffee, to find one that is very tasteful and smooth to the taste. My opinion is: San Francisco Bay Coffee, Fog Chaser is the best."
positive,"The San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser's provide a pretty decent bold coffee at a phenomenal price.  It's about HALF THE PRICE of common competitors.  Well worth ordering.  If you don't like it, you can spend 2X the $$$ on something else the next time. I bet you'll be satisfied with the Fog Chaser."
positive,"For the price, this is one great cup of coffee! I love the fact that the San Francisco Bay coffee cups for Keurig brewers do not have the typical plastic containers. I hate throwing away all that plastic. I tried washing out those little containers but that was such a pain! So these coffee containers make much more sense. The coffee tastes great and the aroma is even better than the original Keurig cups. This is a good alternative and a fantastic price."
positive,"We really like this product. It came in a number of smaller packs, and there was a plastic tub for open bags. I did not have any trouble keeping the coffee fresh. The taste and quality were very good. Similar to s-bux Verona, at a lot lower price! I would purchase this again, any time!"
positive,"I am very much enjoying FogChaser.  The flavor is great!<br /><br />As other posts have mentioned, it does not look like a traditional K cup (which is, incidentally, why the price is so great! No ""k-cup"" royalties, right?) but works just like a Kcup.  The coffee is packaged in bags freshness, and the company thoughtfully included a plastic food storage container for storing the open package.  Sure, it's a cheap-o container, but it works and I think it was a really nice touch by the company to ensure that my opened package of coffee stays fresh.<br /><br />The price is HALF of what I've been paying for my K-Cups from the supermarket, so I am VERY very pleased.  My household goes through 8-10 cups a day, so the savings is significant for us.  5 stars!<br /><br />Happy. :-)"
positive,"I am a helpless coffeeholic and a devoted Keurig User. I was so dissapointed in the k-cups after the Green Mountain takeover, almost to the point of looking for another brewing method. Then my brother in law suggested I try this coffee. WOW! One of the best cups I have ever had from my Keurig.  Not so thrilled with the Rain Forest blend but the Fog Chaser is the bomb! Don't confuse this with Fog Litter. Don't let the difference in the pod scare you, works great in my brewer. I just ordered a pack of the French Roast. Can't wait to try it."
positive,"Not as good as the Starbucks or Newman's brand, if I can afford to buy the better stuff on Amazon I will.  The Coffee has a great aroma, but the coffee is nor memorable after drinking it - it's the Kmart of the K-cups."
positive,It has good flavor. I use it on the 8 ounce cup size & it is not watery or weak
positive,"We were skeptical when we ordered, and received, this product.  It doesn't look like it would fit a Keurig, and is not our top brand coffee.  We both ended up liking it very much, and end up rooting around for the last FOGCHASER, since it is now OUR favorite.  It's nice it has less plastic/packaging than other brands as well...."
positive,Great coffee.  I use these Keurig-compatible sengle serve units both a home and in the office.  I am just about to place a follow-up order.
positive,Have been getting this coffee for several months and very much like their bold flavor in comparison to others I've tried. Keep it air tight after opening is not a big deal. great coffee!
positive,This coffee is a great deal!  All the coffee drinkers in the house enjoy it - will purchase again.  Compared to many others we have tried this is in the top 5.
positive,"I will definitely buy the San Francisco Bay Coffee again.  After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others."
positive,"Tried this pod coffee with a bit of trepidation, first it was a new style pod and 2nd it had several bad reviews.  Tried it anyway and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />1. New pod style worked great.  No issues what so ever.  They pack the pods in small bags so the air does not oxidize the remaining pods.  I use a clip to seal the bag back up after opening.  Maybe they could add a self seal bag type but then they would raise the price on me.  Leave it as is.<br /><br />2. Coffee was great.  Very bold just like I like it.  In fact it was better than the other bolds on my Amazon Subscribe and Save list.  This coffee pod just made the list.<br /><br />All I can say about the reviewers that did not like the bold taste is that perhaps they are only ""wanna be"" bold coffee drinkers.  Maybe they should practice more and then try this blend again."
positive,"I was a little worried due to a few bad rewiews, but this coffe was great, smelled good, tasted great and the price was right!so glad I tried it."
positive,"If you are looking for a consistent cup of coffee with a nice flavor and one thats more robust then this one may be for you. My wife and i subscribed to this coffee after reviewing others opinions and for the price, its a great coffee. Works well in a Keurig machine. Id recommend it."
positive,"This coffee is really delicious and the pods are so convenient and less wasteful, plus cost less.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is a coffee lover.  Its always fresh and convenient.  If you are wanting to try it you won't be disappointed."
positive,"Don't hesitate to buy this fantastic coffee. And, don't let the price fool you! I was elated to see Fog Chaser packaged for the Keurig system. Having bought this blend before I knew what to expect, and it didn't let me down. It delivers a full-bodied cup of coffee, with a fantastic nutty, sweet kinda spicy-chocolaty finish. On the technical side, I like that they've figured out a way to work around using all the plastic. These ""K-Cups"" are an ingenious design using a filter instead. Absolutely a splendid cup of coffee all around. This product has been added to my Subscription orders with Amazon."
positive,"The subscribe & save service is good, product was delivered as required and actually did save me money! The coffee is great and has a good full bodied taste, just what I need to wake me in the mornings."
positive,"This is a great tasting coffee. But not as strong as I was hoping for. I expected it to be stronger then the french and on the lines of Black Tiger and Jet. In my opinion, it's not as strong. I was disappointed. But still a nice flavor."
positive,"This coffee has wonderful flavor and brews very well.  Works perfectly in our Keurig coffee maker.  Really like the pod style, actually easier to use than the cups.  Great product!"
positive,I lover this coffee and will keep buying it.  I never drink Decalf but since getting a Keurig I can have a cup when I get home without brewing a whole pot and just love this decalf as it has the flavor of a full roast coffee.
positive,Tastes excellent and is great for the price. Shipped quickly and the pods came in batches in plastic packages so the pods don't expire.
positive,"San Franciso Bay is an nice, inexpensive alternative to the K-cup.  I like a bold cup of coffee and this one comes through.For the money, this brand is well worth trying.  I paln to purchase again. It works well in my Keurig."
positive,This coffee smells really good.  Even the non-coffee drinkers in my office comment on how rich it smells.  Coffee lovers have been just breathing deeply!  LOL!  This was a test and it passed.  Took some getting used to but I have come to really like it.
positive,"I just received this product.  I was a little hesitant with the product not being enclosed in the cup fully, having an exposed filter.  I was pleased with the brewing and taste of the coffee, it was no different than other kcups I have used.  I have a Cuisinart K-cup brewer and it works great with this coffee.  I recommend this product and plan on ordering more."
positive,Nice product for the price. All you have to use is a zip lock bag because they use a screen for the bottom of the cup. Good medium cup of coffee.
positive,"I am so happy to have found this product.  The different type of cup was no problem at all, is more environmentally friendly, and the coffee is wonderful.  The price is another advantage."
positive,"I am a coffee lover. Drink it all the time, prefer dark roasts with full flavor and typically drink it black unless i crave a drop of honey. I used to buy the very expensive dark roast K-cups but i saw these on sale and decided to try them based on the good reviews. First, the cup itself is awesome.  Far less plastic than 'regular' K-cups, so there's less waste. The flavor is awesome-- dark brew but no bitterness or sourness.  Nice bite, clean aftertaste.  This, in my opinion, tastes more like my local coffee house brew than any other K-cup on the market.  and Amazon has great prices on these, especially with subscribe & save."
positive,"This coffee is just what I wanted - not too bitter and not as strong as some coffees. The aftertaste is easy and smooth. I appreciate the packaging into smaller groups of cups, in order to keep the coffee fresh."
positive,I used to drink Newman's Special Blend or Starbucks Sumatra but this is at least as good and cheaper. I'll spring for the 80-cup box this time.
positive,"I've been looking for a good quality coffe for my Keurig, and have tried many options (Starbucks, Mountain Green, and others).  I now found my coffe, good robust flavor, no bitterness."
negative,I found this coffee very weak - I had to lower the cup size to get some flavor.  I would not order this again.
positive,"They come in bags, I think nitrogen sealed. It is enough to last a week each bag.<br /><br />Flavor: Very bold, very strong but not bitter or acidic. Very much like costco coffee<br />but far more flavorful and complex.<br /><br />Can do a full 10 oz and it is still strong with milk.<br /><br />Less plastic to waste"
positive,Right amount of caffeine to wake you up.  Flavor and strength are fine too.  I will buy these again as soon as I run out.
positive,"I rarely rate things 5 stars, this coffee deserves the top rating. It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time."
positive,"These K-Cups arrived promptly after ordering; the are convenient to use, and the coffee tastes great. Highly recommend the product. Have had no problems."
positive,"I was at first hesitant due to the 'weird' lack of a normal kcup but other reviewers take on this flavor tempted me. THANK U for tempting me, this flavor is crisp, delicious and downright 'good stuff'.<br />I will definitely reorder over and over, now one of my favs."
positive,"This product makes a great cup of cofee, bold but not bitter, no bad after taste. The smell starts the experience  and the satisfied full flavor follows. I will buy this product as long as it is available !!"
negative,"I prefer a stronger bold cup of coffee, which other review promised this brand/type of coffee was, but I found that I had to use the smallest size brew size cup on my keurig to get any flavor at all, therefore using double the pods ( smaller than regular refills)  don't recommend. Too bad because the price is right."
positive,"This coffee is outstanding, nice strong flavor without bitterness.<br />I am wondering if these k-cups can be used in a Kreurig Vue?"
positive,"THIS COFFEE IS SUCH A GOOD FRAGRANCE AND SOOOO GOOOOOOOOD TASTING! THIS IS WHAT I CALL A CUP A JO! AND SMELLS SO WONDERFUL FROM OPENING THE BAG, TO BREWING IT AND DRINKING IT. GOOD JOB ROGERS FAMILY! THANKS! I WILL BE ORDERING MORE FOR SURE. ANY OF THE K CUPS CAN'T TOUCH THIS! BELIEVE ME BECAUSE WE HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!"
positive,when your coffee maker motor starts to weaken and sound like a mack truck . Use these the paper filter makes it easy than those plastic ones and the coffee taste great!
positive,"I just poured my first cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, and it is great! First of all, the Fog Chaser Coffee will do it's job to chase the Fog away: It is REALLY BOLD! I brewed a medium cup because I like bold coffee and was not sure if this brand would deliver. Next time I will not be afraid to brew a large cup. The coffee is rich, flavorful, and did I say Bold?<br /><br />Secondly, I love my Keurig, but hated feeling guilty about all the plastic I was adding to the landfills using the Keurig K-Cups. This pod uses at least 1/3 of the plastic of the standard K-Cup: There is a plastic ring holding the mesh coffee filter pod to the foil cap. Environmentally, this is a step in the right direction. I also feel the design of the pod is what allows the coffee to brew stronger, smoother and with more flavor!<br /><br />My husband does not like his coffee as bold as I do, so I look forward to trying out the other flavors of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup."
positive,Ordered this on Sunday and recieved it on Wednesday. So the shipping was very fast. The cups aren't the usual cups you get from your local store. Looks more like a k pouch. That being said it is good coffee. As soon as I got them I had to try it out. Tasted fresh and brewed very well. I am glad that I have a subscription as this will be a morning regular.
positive,"I tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser since they have reduced the cost & plastic waste by reducing the packaging. I love a good strong cup of coffee and I love my Keurig brewer.  But I am a cheapskate at heart and hated paying the price for the regular K-cups. This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.  That is a small inconvenience I can live with.  They also reduce our use of plastic and the trash we generate and I suspect that there may be health benefits from not brewing the coffee in the little plastic cup."
negative,"This coffee is not what I expected.  I thought it would be a bold coffee similiar to Starbucks, but it is not, and it leaves a sediment in my cup, which other don't .  very disappointed and will not re order this brand again."
positive,My husband and I are always trying new k-cups to see what's new. We were both pleasantly surprised by this coffee. It was bold but really smooth. It's a great morning and just the right kick for the afternoon pick me up.
positive,"I use these in my Keurig B130, they fit well and save plastic. I brew fog chaser over ice- its got a nice medium flavor.<br />The frustration free packaging works fine. I put the opened pods in a ziplock in the freezer- stay fresh for a week."
negative,"This has been running much less than other K cups so I gave it a try.<br /><br />Lower cost than K-cups but more than using an Ekobrew cup with your favorite coffee.<br /><br />Much stronger smell when you open a plastic package.  Not a pleasant coffee smell but some people like that dark a roasting, look at Starbucks.<br /><br />Cons: not very complex, darker almost burnt roasting, some bitterness.<br /><br />If your preferences are more to the Nantucket Blend on the roasting scale this is not for you.<br /><br />Added, I see they have a Breakfast Blend which according to reviews is milder and more complex. However they helpfully point out it is still roasted more than other brands and I believe the amount of roasting is part of my objection to the flavor."
positive,"My wife is the coffee drinker in our house. Pete's, Starbucks and a whole host of local coffee spots come under her purview. And then there are all the coffees at the grocery store. She has now deemed Fog Chaser for her Keurig coffee maker the best!"
negative,"This was an extremely affordable item, but the old adage you get what you pay for applies here.  The coffee was nothing special and tasted like discount coffee.  One of the best aspects of the single-cup coffee maker is that you get a cup of coffee that is strong (depending upon your preference), fresh and, tastes like a cup of coffee from one of the chain reatil locations, without the retail price. This coffee tasted like weak, old coffee - coffee that was made in a drip maker.  In my opinion, not a ""Fog Chaser"" at all."
positive,"Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style has been my favorite (prepackaged) coffee for my Keurig.  Fog Chaser may come in a close second.  I started on this one as the Kona hasn't been available for awhile now.  The Fog Chaser is a medium-bodied blend that does well any time of the day.  I like it iced also.  It's smooth with earth and cedar notes.  Not sweet, but not bitter.  A nice balance.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the plastic bags with the air seals on them.  No coffee, no matter if it's whole bean, refrigerated, or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it's roasted.  Coffee should be drunk in about 2-3 days after it's roasted and for about another 2-4 weeks.  The majority of flavor in coffee comes from it's aromatics, and they are gone in a relatively short period of time.  When I have time I buy green coffee beans, roast them in my air pop popcorn poppers, wait 2-3 days, grind as needed, and drink it all in the next 2-4 weeks.  TMALST  These won't go bad if you leave the bag open on a counter."
positive,This coffee is delicious but very strong. Not for the faint of heart...it will wake you up!!!It has a wonderfully rich aroma while brewing and a deep yet not bitter taste. This is a great deal for K-cups and supports an environmentally friendly company. I would wholehearted recommend.
positive,"I've really enjoyed this K-cup. The coffee is strong and flavorful and I love that the Cups are recyclable. After I open the package, I put the remaining K-cups in a container in the refrigerator to help keep them fresh."
positive,"I thought this product would be amazing, based on the way it smelled when I opened the bag, but it was just average. Not great, but not awful."
positive,"After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the French Roast. Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine."
positive,This is great stuff.  One of my all time favorites.  If you like strong coffee then you will like this.
positive,"PLEASE READ!!!!! Do not let the bad reviewers drive you away, I almost didn't order these because of them. If you like REAL coffee not fluffed up flavored coffee but real coffee this is for you. I have tried pretty much every K-cup on the market and the only ones I enjoy are midnight magic and jet fuel. If you like either of these two you will enjoy this cup of coffee. A little about my coffee preference, I mainly enjoy french pressed strong coffees because the flavors are out of this world. I do have a Keurig (Christmas gift) for about 5 years now, sad part is I only use this if I ran out of time in the morning. With all of that said do realize this is not even remotely close to a french press but is now being added to my very small k-cup approval list."
positive,"What I really like about this K-Cup is that it is not a normal K-Cup encased in plastic. The coffee is enclosed in a filter, which results in less plastic in the landfills. In addition, the coffee itself is a nice strong cup worthy of it's name, Fog Chaser. It is my favorite cup of coffee in the morning. I have made it a point to subscribe and have it delivered every month."
positive,"I first bought this at a local grocery and liked it so much I went to amazon to purchase it on an automatic delivery.  It has a different packaging than most, but it works the same.  The pricing is much better than purchasing either in the store or online individually.  This is my first auto delivery from amazon.  I am very pleased with the coffee and the shipping process."
positive,"Count me among the fans. I love the lower-waste design of these k-cup compatible pods. It is a mild inconvenience keeping them in an airtight container, but the investment in a tight-sealing jar paid for itself with the first case. It was smart to package them in bags of 12, so each bag is only open for about a week.  The coffee is good. Not astonishingly strong, but pretty rich and balanced. They don't advertise it here, but the company's coffee is fair trade/direct trade as well!"
positive,"A friend offered me a cup of this about a week ago. Wonderful stuff! Disappointing when he told me, it's not in stores. (At least not around here, so I have to order on Amazon...) It's great tasting coffee!  And more importantly, even though it brews in the Keurig, it's NOT in little plastic cups.<br />More than two years ago I switched to the oh-so-convenient K-Cups, despite reservations about brewing coffee in little plastic cups. (1)Very hot water steeps in Plastic cups. (2)Lots of little plastic cups go into landfills or incinerators.  Now, finally, there's a product with all the convenience of the K-cup brewers, but none of the drawbacks!  Why didn't someone think of this sooner?"
positive,"I really like this coffee. It's bold, yet smooth as well. I especially appreciate the simpler packaging with much less plastic waste. Additionally, I don't think the coffee grounds touch plastic at all, just the foil top and filter. They work impeccably in my Keurig."
positive,I like a bolder coffee than my husband does and this one is good enough for me. It leaves a pleasant after-flavor. I am impressed also with the design of the cups. I'd certainly order it again.
negative,"It was much too ""sharp/harsh"" for me.  Had to add cinnamon and half-and-half just to get it down.  Really sorry I purchased two boxes of it!"
negative,"I purchased this because another reviewer likened it to Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Unfortunately it is not even close.<br />The first cup seemed fine. The flavor immediately after brewing is good, but as soon as it cools down some it turns harsh fast.<br />The open-filter is a poor design. It can and absolutely will go stale.  I compared the scent of the final coffee pouch(cup?) from a previously opened bag to a newly opened, and the scent is completely different. Think old coffee can vs. freshly opened.<br />The other gripe on the filter is the poor filtration. There is always sediment at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />About me: I am very picky about my coffee. I drink it straight black and brew at 8oz with double filtered water in a Cuisinart Keurig coffee maker.  I don't reuse k-cups!<br />My favorite coffees are Coffee People's Black Tiger and Jet Fuel, Caribou's Mahogany and Van Houtte's Eclipse."
positive,"Both my wife and I like this coffee.  one brew per cup for her is how she likes.  I brew a cup 1-1/2 times to get the flavor I like.  Very good price.  If there is a down side it would be the container is not your typical k-kup, rather a round filter at the bottom holding the coffee.  It works fine in the Keurig and we keep ours unused in an air tight container to keep fresh"
positive,wonderful full bodied coffee and a great price; much less 'offensive' packaging than a normal K-cup; works just like a normal K-cup; no problems.
positive,"The taste was ok, but every cup ended up having sediment at the bottom of the cup.  I will not be buying this brand again.  So far, Brooklyn Bean Cyclone and Coffee People Jet Fuel are my favorites."
positive,"No sediment, just great tasting (and smelling) coffee.  Tired of Emeril's constant price changes and packaging changes.  This is as hearty as Emeril and as smooth with less waste to Mother Earth and much less money.  Very impressed, been using Keurig for over 5 years and this coffee is great."
positive,"Very smooth with no aftertaste, slightly bold. I use a medium size setting, I think 7 1/4 oz. on my maker. It seems necessary to store them in an airtight container after opening, to keep fresh. One of my current favorites."
positive,Great coffe! Ordered the French roast to see if it is as good. The pod design is very good.<br />Enjoy!
positive,"After buying the SFB French Roast K-Cups, I thought I would give the Fog Chaser a chance.  Wow!  What a good and strong cup of coffee.  Stronger than the French Roast.  I will keep buying these!<br /><br />Just an update:  Recently I found k-cups on sale and bought a box of what used to be my favorite.  After brewing the coffee and drinking it, I realized, I did not like it!  The SF Fog Chaser is superior to the k-cups offered.  Will not go back to the regular k-cups again."
positive,"I stumbled across this coffee, and I'm so glad I did !!!  Just received it today, was curious so I made a cup.  Great flavor, a bit bold, but very smooth.  I think my husband will love it tomorrow morning.  Signed up for the auto shipments, which takes the price a bit lower and I don't have to place an order every month.  Great product and love the auto ship !!!!"
positive,"I was a bit skeptical when I saw to alternative to the original K-Cup,  I tried the Fog Chaser and have to say it is a great product.  Good balanced flavor and strong too.  I usually buy coffee by the case at Costco but this is a superior option.  Less plastic also makes them more ecologically friendly and potentially recyclable.  Two Thumbs Up!"
positive,I am so glad I read the reviews on this coffee product.  The cups fit the Keurig very well and make a tasty cup of coffee!  I like the fact that there is no plastic base to it (less plastic in the trash).  I will buy it again and again.  My favorite coffee thus far.  I have subscribed to this so it will be shipped automatically every month.
positive,"Fog Chaser is a pleasant tasting cup of coffee. I like the more environmentally friendly cup/pod design, but since it comes twelve in a plastic bag, I don't know if it is a net eco-plus. I also can buy it at Wegman's for much less than from Amazon."
positive,"This is an intense, rich, flavorful coffee. While I like a robust flavor, this one seems quite acidic. It does ""chase fog"", for sure! I think it has a real caffeine kick to it. The cups are intersting in that they have a wider brim so they fit right into the Keurig without touching the bottom poker. I brewed a 12oz. cup and a 16oz. cup. The 16 was more to my liking, but the acidity of the coffee made it difficult to finish either cup. Just a little too strong for my liking. Interesting packaging. We drink several cups a day, so I don't believe it would get stale. And they do fit right in the carousel."
positive,"This is a great full bodied coffee. I have tasted different brands and have a few I would call favorites, this is one. The design of the K-Cup without the plastic cup at the bottom is very different but you don't even miss it. You will love the taste of this coffee.<br />I haven't tried the other flavors San Francisco Bay puts out but I'm tempted."
positive,"Bravo for the new Eco Friendly Pod.  I actually forgot what fresh, real coffee tastes like.  At first I was taking back but the strong, robust flavor.  Then after a few sniffs and sips I felt rejuvenated.  For the first time since I got my Keurig I realized that I missed fresh brewed coffee.  The taste is so fresh, so lively, so good.  The price is also an added bonus.  This Crazy Coffee Mom is really hooked."
positive,"It fits fine in my Kreuig.  My low rating is for taste. It was ok, not terrible... but not something I am excited to have in the mornings.  Put some flavored creamer in it and all's good."
positive,"These ""cups"" have a little filter at the bottom instead if a plastic cup which allows for less waste in the trash can, yeah!! I always felt kind of guilty putting so many plastic cups in the garbage. Now to the coffee it is absolutely the best I have had.  A 10oz cup is possible without tasting too watery, especially with the French roast.  Every one of the Rogers family cups are great.  The fog chaser is a little smoother than the french roast but nice and dark.  The french roast is great also not quite as bitter as the usual french roast even the decaf is great.  This coffee rivals fresh brewed easily and is less expensive which is a bonus for those of us who want the freedom of K cups but don't like the price.  I will buy this brand from now on, I am a loyal customer of this Old San Francisco Bay Coffee.  Rogers family thanks for bringing real coffee to Keurig."
positive,"When I ordered this coffee, I hoped the majority of the reviews were correct, and they were. I am really happy with Fog Chaser. I've bounced around through all the Keurig dark roasts and in my opinion, this is better than all of them. The aroma and taste far surpass any K-cup I've ever had. I store the coffee in an air-tight container, and have had no problems with freshness. They work perfectly in my B70 brewer, and I do wash the K-cup holder every couple of days or so because these have a real filter instead of plastic. The price is great, especially with Subscribe and Save - never going back to plastic K-Cups!"
positive,"A perfect blend, and a good bargain.  The coffee ""pod"" cups fit perfectly in the Keurig.  I bought this coffee for my husband who is a fussy coffee drinker.  He loves it!"
positive,Great coffee flavor.  Great price!  Like this method.  Use coffee canister to store once open package.  I use the subscription for an even better price.
positive,"Coffee has a very good taste, is not bitter and has a pleasant aroma. The only problem I have with it is it comes in a fiber womb, not plastic like most other K-Cups. And sometimes it allows the coffee sediment to leak through. It doesn't happen all the time, found to be about 20-25% of the time. Also you have to place cups in a zip lock baggie to keep fresh, after you open Mfg's.bag. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 Stars."
positive,"First of all, the coffee is quite rich, and definitely appropriately labeled Fog Chaser!  Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling."
positive,"This variety is strong and bold!  The price is reasonable as it is.  But, if you want to stretch your K-cup value even more, you can make 2 cups from one K-cup.  I brew a medium and a small cup into my large coffee cup.  And, it's still a strong cup of coffee!  I like this so much that I signed up for subscribe and save!"
positive,"I generally like the stronger coffees.  A lot of the k-cups have been very weak and flavorless.  I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what ""smell"" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.  I singed up for the subscribe and save to get it delivered regularly so I dont run out.  I just hope others find it as great tasting as I do so amazon keeps carrying it!"
positive,"I wish I didn't feel like I have to give this product a low rating, but I wouldn't buy it again without some changes.  It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.  BTW, he said he considers the sediment minimal, and not much of an issue at all."
positive,"After reading the reviews that indicated a non-traditional k-cup packaging, I was a little leery-- but the packaging works well in my coffee maker and leaves no residue in the cup. The coffee is delicious-- I tend to prefer strong blends and this is satisfying. Good product, good price."
positive,I have owned a Keurig for about 2 years now and this is by far the tastiest cup of coffee I've had and I've tried LOTS. I love the little paper filter as opposed to the full plastic jacket of most K-cups. It's a keeper!
positive,"These brilliant K-cups have about 10-20% of the plastic of a normal K-cup.  A persistent criticism of K-Cups in the press is the amount of plastic that winds up in the landfill.  We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.  It's hard for me to judge the taste - I add milk and sugar - but the bouquet is pleasing."
positive,"Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer).<br /><br />Less waste: I was terribly disappointed when I discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable.  These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store.  I buy my k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them!  Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price.  At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay way less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Ok, obviously this is the most important factor...and so as soon as they arrived I threw one in and...hurray, they're tasty!  Fog Chaser is a slightly less strong taste than I usually drink, but I find it pleasant & smooth & complex in flavor.  It tastes like it smells, which is very nice.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription.  How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?  You really can have it all.<br /><br />Update a month later: this roast has really grown on me!"
positive,"This coffee has a wonderful flavor.  It is very aromatic.  I love this coffee and the price!  I love my Keurig, but k cups are spendy.  This product is perfect."
positive,"Wow! When I first tried this coffee my response was ""That's way too strong""! And yet, after getting into the 2nd cup, I found that I am starting to enjoy real coffee again. Definitely the big favorite in our house, and highly recommended. Also, a little less plastic in the landfill, so that's a plus."
positive,"I purchased the Fogchaser Kcups and really enjoyed the strong earthy taste. The coffee tastes like ""organic"" grown beans. I stopped buying Kcups because I just wasn't getting the caffeine kick that I demand from my coffee. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is the only Kcup coffee I have ever purchased that actually tastes like strong black coffee as opposed to the usual Kcup brew of hot colored water.<br /><br />I will definitely keep my ""Subscribe and Save"" order for SFB Fog Chaser coffee."
positive,"I have been having trouble with my small Keurig with the regular kcups.  (this is the smallest Mr Coffee made by Keurig and is brand new), but it would only brew half a cup and sometimes the pressure would rupture the seal on the k cup and grounds would overflow...I bought the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser and not only is the taste awesome...but my keurig loves them...I think the filter bottom vs, the plastic cup allows the water to flow thru better and I get a full cup every time and no more mess!  I was going to return the Keurig and try something different...Not now!  Mr. Coffee Single Serve Powered by Keurig Brewing Technology"
positive,"Life is hectic and it's the small things that matter.  A fresh start to each day with a cup of great coffee!  The personalized product of the one cup San Francisco Bay is AMAZING!  The depth, aroma, flavor, color are far superior to others on the market.  Great quality, great price, great cup of coffee-"
negative,"I really liked this coffee, but it will not be on my list of coffees to buy again because of the one major flaw.  It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again."
negative,"I at first thought I ordered the wrong product, and had to go back and check. This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future."
positive,"I found this coffee to be a bit too mild and flavorless for my taste. It reminded me a lot of the coffee I sometimes have to have when the family all wants to stop at Mcdonalds for breakfast. I also found that the coffee pods/K-cup quickly lost its freshness after two days. I had it inside an air tight container but soon after a couple of days the freshness was gone and the aroma of the coffee smelled like the can of Folgers that my mother-in-law has on her shelf. They also make a french roast which I thought was OK. But again, a bit weak for a french roast coffee. The french roast coffee, as was with the fog chaser,after a couple of days, soon lost its flavor and the aroma became ""Folgers coffee"" like. I guess the packaging makes a difference. In conclusion, I do not think I will be purchasing this again."
negative,"I picked this up at a Fresh & Easy.  While I like the idea of more choices than the officially licensed K-Cups, this is just not a good coffee.  It tastes bitter and bland.  Not recommended.  Try Millstone's Fogchaser K-Cups instead."
positive,"I am so happy that I found this coffee. I have been using a Keurig for years now, and tried many of the single use cups on the market. I have even used the cups that you fill with your own coffee, but nothing compares to this San Francisco Bay coffee! And can you beat the price? Love the coffee, love the price and love the convenience of the 80 count box."
positive,This coffee is at least as good as any of the actual Keurig K-cups at a much lower price. I will definitely order it again!
positive,"I love my Keurig, but the cost of the cups had me looking for a better deal, and I was getting tired of adding to the plastic in the world with every cup of coffee.  I tried peeling the tops and bought the new lids to iron on (too messy and time consuming) and I do have the refillable cups you can use repeatedly, but those are messy, too.  I always thought the goal of a Keurig was a quick single cup of good coffee without the mess or fuss of a regular coffee maker. During a recent browsing day on Amazon, I ordered this product.  Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue!  Spouse and I love the coffee, it is rich (read strong) enough for him, and tasty for me (I add a little hot water to mine.)  If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom.  The cups come in sealed bags of 10 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 80 is no problem.  This purchase was cheaper than my local Costco, too.  I also bought the decaf, and it is great as well.  Definitely a recommend!"
positive,I was going to go back to a traditional coffee maker until I found these pods.  They are the strong and I enjoy the flavor of the coffee.
positive,"I just received my order for the San Francisco Bay K-cups ""Fog Chaser"" I am drinking it as I am writing , it is the BEST....If you like a nice robust coffee with yet a smooth flavor, then this is it. I have tried the actual K-Cup variety and NONE of any of their flavors came even close to this strong, yet , smooth great taste. I will def. be re-ordering this in my future. For the price and the amount you get , $17.49 FOR 36 COUNT whatttttaaaaa deal !!! They are also a lil different then the original K-cups, the have a filter type bottom but fit and brew just fine. I have not tried the Lavazza Gran Crema Expresso or the Dark Hot Chocolate, which was also part of my order, yet... <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
positive,Really love this newly designed cup for my Keurig. Coffee is delicious and aromatic. Less plastic waste is produced and the price is much lower than the traditional k-cups.
positive,"I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but the reviews were mostly good so I tried it. I occasionally like a cup of Tully's Kona (outrageously priced right now) or Folgers Black Silk, but I have made the San Francisco Fog Chaser my regular morning cup. The 36-pod order comes in three air-tight bags of 12 each.  I open them as I use them, putting the pods in a jar to maintain freshness.  Going to order more soon!"
positive,"Having tried 20 or more different k-cup varieties from Amazon over the past 2 years, I must say that this is probably one of the best (if not THE best) k-cup variety I have purchased.  I was skeptical at first because the pictures showed a lack of complete shell for the coffee, and I wasn't sure how the pressure brewing would work.  But I must say that this coffee has more aroma, strength and flavor than most Keurig brewed coffees.  It comes in small bags, containing 12 each.  I usually transfer them to a freezer bag right away once I open each bag.  This helps keep the flavor a little more.  I like it so much that I started my first coffee subscription from Amazon for this product!  If you love coffee, you MUST give this a try, at least once."
positive,"I read the other reviews and decided to give this brand and style of Keurig cup a try. I, like many, am now a believer. The coffee is excellent and I agree with others who say the taste is enhanced by eliminating the plastic cups other brands use. My wife who is not a ""coffee drinker"" (per se) even prefers these. Also, the price is relatively reasonable."
positive,"I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob. Living alone I love K-cups ability to brew a single cup instead of wasting a whole pot. I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones. The taste of these is bolder and stronger than even the most potent plastic version. Lastly these will biodegrade a lot quicker than the plastic ones making them better for the environment.<br /><br />One last quick tip: Put them in a ziplock to retain that fresh ground coffee smell and taste."
positive,"Found this coffee at Costco, 80 count for $25.95, purchased 1 box, should have bought more!!! Went back today to buy more and they have discontinued it ! My whole Italian Family loves this Fog Chaser Coffee, we have been using other flavors, mostly Paul Newman's, but we like this much better, It is Rich, but not strong, it has a wonderful taste that appeals to us. I will be ordering the 80 count from Amazon, I am so happy to find it available."
positive,This coffee is so much better than the K-cups you get in the grocery store. And I love the K-cup design. I'm<br />on auto-ship so I don't run out.
positive,"I really enjoy this coffee! I was skeptical about the packaging, thinking it wouldn't fit correctly in my Keurig, but it did! And for the price, AWESOME! I have used the refillable Kcups, the ones where you can get lids and ""refill"" other cups, but hate it! (I guess I am too lazy to keep refilling and cleaning my kcup) This coffee tastes good too, not the best I have had, but good! I still get most of my Kcups from Kohls when I get a 30% off, I stock up-I love the variety packs there! But I will definitely keep getting these!"
positive,"this is a very enjoyable 'cup'. the packaging is not a normal plastic,but a mesh of a sort.it did not pose any problem for my machine. the only thing i worry about,perhaps needlessly, will the 'mesh cause a decrease in shelf life.it comes in a airti ght clear plastic package but i break the package and add the kcups to my other kcups on 50 unit display unit. anyway the coffee is nice. im not a expert but i would say its a medium,so it required 2 mugs for my normal bowl movement.im retired so it does not pose a problem.but you younger whipper-snappers may want to keep that in mind. i always kept a small bucket in my car for that reason when i was young,just saying. and no,thats not gross,whats gross is not to have a bucket,cant make it to a rest room,or when u get to one,its in use. be perpared,anyway happyness and peace to u,ur family,and friends,bye-bye."
positive,"they are not contained in the keurig plastic cup so once you open the package, you'll want to put them in an airtight storage but i was really impressed with the smooth flavor and good taste. these were a little cheaper than most of the keurig kcups i've found so i was not sure what to expect but these are deff up there on my favorites list."
positive,"Great strong coffee perfect for the morning.  Like the minimal plastic use on the k-cup itself - instead of a plastic bottom it has a paper filter that works fine.  Comes in three bags of 12 cups each, once a bag is opened I just store them in a tupperware until I use them."
positive,I was disappointed that Timothy's Midnight Magic was no longer available as a Subscribe and Save item. I looked around for a replacement that has a bold flavor and was economical. After reading several reviews I ordered a case of Fog Chaser. This coffee is great. Really great. I also picked up a case of Starbucks Cafe Verona and I prefer the Fog Chaser. It has a wonderful aroma and a bold but not harsh flavor that I really enjoy. The slight inconvenience of having to keep it in a air tight bag to keep it fresh is mitigated by the excellent flavor and price. It's a good trade-off. I have a case coming every month and I may run out sooner.
positive,"Great bold taste and aroma.  I would recommend to coffee drinkers who enjoy a strong cup of coffee  Tha pods are ""greener""  in packaging.  Good job San Francisco  bay Co.<br />Fairly priced."
positive,SanFrancisco Bay coffee is GREAT love this stuff.  Flavor is very good flavor dark but not bitter will buy again
negative,"The price of this coffee and the fact that it could be a little ""earth friendly"" convinced me to at least try it. The coffee came packaged as described, so ""hat's off"" to the seller. But that first cup just didn't do it for me. It's lacking that rich dark coffee taste and the pods leave a residue at the bottom of the cup, so that last gulp just doen't happen. I'd rather fill the little coffee baskets, use a mini-coffee liner and fill it with my favorite coffees than buy this product again. But again, this is a $reasonable$ price for Keurig compatible cofee."
negative,"I was hoping this would be as good as many people said, but it falls way short!  The price was great, but the taste wasn't.  It tastes like cheap regular coffeepot coffee!  And it was too weak as compared to many stronger Keurig coffees.  I will stick with my trusted Dark Magic.  I can make a 12oz. cup and have it taste like coffee.  This brand I had to reduce it to 6oz. to get something I could drink. That's not cheaper nor more convenient when I have to make two cups in the morning."
positive,"Very good coffee, but must keep bag sealed at all times.  It will pick up other flavors.  Other than that it is great!  AND takes up less room than a kcup."
positive,I opened my Fog Chaser coffee and immediately thought I had ordered the wrong thing because it looked different from my k cups. I read the reviews and found out I was just confused by the different packaging. I brewed a cup and it was a very good cup of coffee. It worked perfectly in my Keurig maker. My story has a happy ending.
positive,Fog Chaser lives up to it's name!!  One cup and I'm good to go.  I love the style of the cup as well... less plastic!
positive,"Good and bad for without a bottom k-cup plastic.  Good is that like one user say, no hot water going through another plastic.  Bad, is that you need to keep the coffee in a sealed bag once you opened the factory sealed bag.  I wish it comes with a resealable bag for this.  They already save money by not using the plastic bottom half of the k-cup.<br />The coffee do taste good though."
positive,"This coffee is very rich and fresh .  The only downside of this product is that when you brew it you should have a wide brimmed cup under it, because it comes out of the pot, in an uneven stream and goes all over.  Other wise its delicious."
positive,"This is really a great cup of coffee. It has a deep complex taste and is not at all bitter. It is a good balanced strong tasting brew if made at the 8oz recommended level. While not a K-cup per se, it is just as well thought out with it's open mesh design. It is basically the inside of the K-Cup without the plastic bottom.  The person that gave it 2 stars because he/she says the 1st cup may be good but the rest will go stale, is just plain stupid. I guess he/she has never heard of a plastic bag or container. Once you open the package just stick them in an airtight container or plastic bag...oooh that's difficult! I wonder when he wrote that review if he had something more than just coffee in his cup??"
positive,"No, these do not look like traditional K-cups, but worked perfectly in my machine. They have eliminated the plastic lower portion of the package which has created a more enviromentally friendly product, although many who like to display their pods will be disappointed because you have to stick them in a zip lok bag after opening (boo hoo). If you open a traditional K-cup it looks exactly the same. Anyway, the coffee is amazing!! Bold but not overwhelming. Perfect for starting the day!<br /><br />Thanks for providing these Amazon!"
positive,Have the rest of you coffee lovers nearly fainted over the sharply rising price of coffee? When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love.
negative,"I wanted to try this in my K-cup brewer because of the positive reviews and the lower price; however, I did not like the flavor of the fog chaser coffee.  I've since tried the rainforest blend, which is better, but still not as good as the Donut House k-cups from Coffee People,which I chose when the Kona blend was no longer available.  I'm debating whether to try the breakfast blend; too bad I have to purchase 36 of them just to try them, though."
negative,"this stuff is so oily, you probably could run your car on it. it takes 1\4 cup creamer to make it change from black to tan ick !!!!"
negative,"I was enticed by the cool design - less trash is good. The price obviously was also very enticing.<br />When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag.<br />So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful.<br />Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried. The decaf French Roast was even less likable..."
negative,This coffee is very stale tasting and gives off no good aroma.  I thought I would be getting a strong coffee because of the name!  Instead it is very weak.  I can't return it so in the garbage it will go or maybe sell it at my next garage sale.
negative,"When I received my latest order, the bag said ""36 count"" but there are only 12 K-cups inside.  That makes this very very expensive coffee."
negative,This coffee is horrible and unfortunately not eligible for return. It tastes like burnt wood shavings. Looks like its going into the compost pile.
negative,"This coffee was not even drinkable. It was so strong even adding double the water and extra cream and sugar didn't help. We like strong coffees, Starbucks original, but this was too much."
negative,"I regret to say that we were disappointed with the coffee pods.  Immediately upon opening the package there was an obvious lack of wonderful coffee aroma, but rather a stale one.  Although the title of the coffee itself was most appealing, we would not purchase again.  Thanks for letting me remark.<br /><br />\"
positive,"Finally...a coffee for my new machine that I like.  Usually the coffee I have tried has been too bitter with a nasty after taste.  This Fog Chaser is just wonderful.  I can finally enjoy more than one cup of coffee in my day.  Any coffee will pretty much do first thing in the morning, but that awful after taste has no place in my afternoons.  Fog Chaser is flavorful but smooth. If you have had difficulty finding a good coffee for the new machines, do give this one a try."
negative,"The Good:<br />+ Eco-friendly packaging<br />+ Less expensive per cup<br /><br />The Bad:<br />+ Stale taste<br /><br />While I was excited to see the innovative packaging of this new product, it just doesn't taste good.  It tastes likes the coffee is stale, which makes sense considering that the coffee is exposed to air.  I realize the packaging reduces the amount of ""exposed air"" but it doesn't matter - the taste speaks for itself."
positive,The coffee is not bad however the product is not a full K-cup. There is a K-cup top and a filter bottom. By not being a full K-cup it looses the benefit of being air tight and not as fresh as others.
negative,"As others have mentioned, these arent k-cups.  Its a paper top with a filter bag full of coffee stuck to it, no plastic bottom.  So the coffee will go stale far faster than a real k-cup and they dont fit properly in my k-cup rack.<br /><br />You have to license the patented k-cup design and pay green mountain a couple of pennies per cup made in royalties, these guys seem to have tried to cut that corner.  But I wont buy them again, I buy k-cups because I want a fresh cup of coffee not something thats been exposed to circulating air until I use it."
negative,"Im usually happy with all my purchases from Amazon, however this was my worst purchase ever. I went by other peoples reviews when I purchased this coffee. The coffee was rated good by everyone so I took my chances and ordered it. My boyfriend and I both tried it and it was not drinkable! The taste and the smell of it was terrible! I didn't even feel I could give them away to anyone because I didn't want to subject anyone else to the terrible taste of it, so I tossed them in the garbage. What a waste of money! I will stick with familiar brands like Green Mountain."
negative,"Received the package and tried one out immediately. I don't know what the expected shelf life is on a coffe kcup but I think this one expired a long time ago. The coffee had a harsh smell, like when you left the can open and the coffee went stale. The taste was bitter and did not meet my expectations. Cross it off my list!!!!"
negative,"I'm all for eco-friendlier packaging, but this coffee goes bad the minute you open the package. Even the first pod out is a bit stale, and anyhow the flavor is terrible to begin with. Yuck!"
negative,This is NOT equal to doughnut shop coffee.<br />This is a STRONG coffee. Not to my likeing!!!!<br />I would NOT recommend it...
negative,"I made the mistake of buying 72 of these K-cups. The other reviews were good, so I thought I would like them. First of all, I enjoy strong coffee thats not bitter.  When I got these and opened up a pack, the odor was wierd, in a way thats kind of hard to describe, they smelled terrible, not like coffee at all. They are to be used in the Keurig machines but have a filter casing, not plastic like the regular K- cups, which is not a problem.  The coffee tasted terrible. The date was fresh, so it wasnt that the coffee was old. I will never again waste my money on this brand.  I cant understand why the company would put out a product like this and expect it to sell, I for one will never buy it again.  I drink alot of coffee, 4 cups at least daily, So far the best ones I have had are the Starbucks,Caribou,and Newmans Own (bold).I hope this helps with your future buying decision. John from Buffalo"
positive,"I was unhappy with the smell and taste of the kcups.  There wasn't any.<br />This product has such a great smell when you open the package and bold<br />flavor when you drink it. I missed it maybe due to the no fuss package.<br />I didn't need or want the extra box it comes in but the plactic package<br />it comes in should be air tight but it wasn't.  Other than that, the price<br />was good as well at the timely manner it was rec'd."
negative,"While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant."
positive,"San Francisco Bay 'Fog Chaser' is true to it's name. It will definitely lift the morning fog and get you going. It's a very strong brew, but isn't harsh. You will not question whether you have had a cup of coffee though. You will know.<br /><br />I like it so well that I've got it on a subscription."
positive,"This was a repeat purchase, so nothing more need be said!  Although this is a very pleasing coffee, it is not Jet Fuel.  This is not a knock, but rather a statement of fact!  Fog Chaser has its own taste, one you don't have to search for.  Once the pak of 12 has been opened, store the remaining pods in a seal-tight container.  And the PRICE is RIGHT!  :o)"
positive,"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning."
negative,When I purchased this I wasn't concerned about not being a traditional k cup and I was looking for a cheaper bold coffee. This just doesn't do it. It's a medium at best and not very consistant from pod to pod. I won't be purchashing this again..
negative,"I bought these expecting a standard K cup.  What I received was a coffee pod that is smaller in size than a K cup and appears to be a ""filter"" type material vice a plastic container.  As a result, they do not fit in the standard K cup dispensers and the coffee does not stay fresh like the standard K cup.  It appears the ""filter"" type material (like fine rice paper) of this coffee pod allows free flow of air and allows the coffee to go stale.  Requires you to store the coffee pods in a zip lock bag to ensure freshness remains.<br /><br />I will not buy these type K coffee pods again and I am surprised that the Amazon web site does not clearly identify the K cup material issue<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++<br />UPDATE-I emailed Amazon regarding the web site issue not being clear as to KCup packaging type.  Amazon refunded my money since they want the customer happy.  Amazon is a great place to shop and has high customer focus and is very much appreciated."
negative,"I'm shocked at all the good reviews for this sludge...I found it to be akin to VERY watery mud. Horrible, and not an item eligible for return with Amazon unfortunately. A total rip off! Now, I'll splurge for the keurig k-cups; lesson learned the hard way :("
negative,if you buy this coffee you will know you made a mistake when you open the first plastic bag it comes packaged in. You can tell by the smell that it's.......NOT!
positive,"I must be doing something wrong because I feel this coffee is way too strong for a single 8oz. cup of coffee.  But, I bought it so I'm shoveling some of the coffee out of the container before I put it in my Rival single cup maker (which has no piercing device).  Some have called this a full bodied medium roast coffee; I call it strong.  The cups are more rounded on the bottom but they do fit in my device.  I'll use up the ocffee and then try something even milder as this is too strong for my taste buds."
positive,"the coffee was not that good at first; it had a strong smell that kind of reminded me of an ashtray (seriously, it did)! But after a couple of cups it became very tasty and it had a nice kick to it. So, give it a chance and you'll probably like it."
negative,"This has got to be the worst thing I've tasted out of my Keurig, ever!! I couldn't even finish the cup I brewed.<br /><br />I don't really mind that they're not actually K-Cups. Who cares if they get stale? You're not going to want to drink the coffee even if it's fresh.<br /><br />I just wanted to edit to describe the flavor better. It tastes burnt. It tastes like someone put their cigarette out in my coffee. I'm out of my good Timothy's K-Cups so I had to use these again tonight, and once again, I'm bot going to be able to finish it."
negative,"I'd like to be able to review this product - however, San Francisco Coffee did not include it in my shipment. Although noted on the invoice, along with the French Roast ordered, they sent two boxes of French Roast and did not correct the shipment when notified.  Therefore, one star it is!<br />BTW - the French Roast is a 4 star."
negative,"this has a chemical taste that ruins it for me, have to put in extra creme. will not buy again, will go back to<br />dognut shop, which is excellent."
negative,First of all the way the K-cup is pakaged tends to let the product dry out.Also found the coffee weak tasting......
negative,"The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly.  But even if used quickly they are weak and watery.  Actually, more like dishwater.  They should come with a warning label.  I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design."
negative,"Extremely disappointed in the quality of this brand's brewing quality.  Will not order this particular brand again.  Will dispose of, instead of being disappointed the majority of the time."
negative,"Thought I was getting a good deal on these K-cups...but this is the worst coffee we have ever had!  The taste is so strange and for it to be called Fog Chaser, I thought it would be strong.  It's not very weak...see through coffee.  Will never buy again."
negative,"I bought these at the grocery store just to try them. They are probably the worst k cups ever. The taste is terrible. I tried both the fog chaser and rainforest blend. They both taste awful, like bark and dirt. There is dark brown ""sediment"" left in the bottom of the cup when you drink this brand. I find that the taste is strong in the dirt department, but highly lacking in the coffee flavor area. I will never buy these again. I like my coffee in the morning, but I actually dread having to use these if there is nothing else available."
negative,"Its not a real K cup.<br /><br />There is no way to store them except in a air tight container or ziplock bag, also when you get to the bottom of your coffee cup there is alot of sediment and grounds,its really gross.<br /><br />I would stick the real K Cups and skip this.Remember amazon does not offer refunds on this either since its a grocery item."
positive,"I believe this coffee tastes as good as any brand of K-Cup I've ever tried while currently costing about a third less (using subscribe and save on Amazon).  It actually tastes fresher to me than other K-Cups, possibly because it arrives packed in a plastic bag which seems airtight until opened."
positive,"I was a little worried about this k-cup since it is shaped differently from the regular k-cups. Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic. The bottom part is enclosed in a coffee filter type holding. While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma. There is no bitter or burned taste. This is quickly becoming my favorite keurig coffee and I can't wait to try the other offerings from this company."
negative,"I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box."
positive,"This is my second favorite flavor from SFBC.  Breakfast blend is still the best.  All flavors have plenty of flavor for a 16oz travel mug. (If you don't have the larger cup size on your machine, brew at the small cup setting and lift the handle and brew again) Can't beat the value especially if you get them via Amazon subscription.  Hey Amazon when are you going to sell these in the 80 pack?"
positive,"We've ordered the Fog Chaser OneCup twice now. The first time we ordered it, I LOVED it. We are avid coffee drinkers in my house, and both love a nice bold coffee. Since the price was right and we liked the coffee, we ordered again. The 2nd shipment we received was still ""good"" coffee, but it wasn't as great as the first. My husband says he couldn't tell much difference, but the 2nd shipment did not have the same smooth finish and mouth-watering aroma as the original. That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a ""crema"" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely. I do think we will try this again and see if ""the third time is the charm"". I will try to remember to update on what we think so that we can provide some feedback as far as consistency goes.<br />Thanks for reading!"
positive,"Bold and rich. LOVE this coffee for a fast wake-me-up in the morning, and pick-me-up mid day. The name is perfectly suited to the delightful temperament of this brew. MUST store in airtight container after opening the plastic bags though, or coffee will lose it's potency."
positive,"Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more ""green"" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma."
positive,"SFBC's Fog Chaser is on the bold side... dark, rich, but not too much aftertaste.  A great daily coffee. Be aware that the entire cup is not plastic, but the bottom portion is almost filter material. This might affect how long you keep the cups before using. The cups are vacuum sealed into a larger plastic bag, so that should help with freshness...<br /><br />The cost is on the low end for k-cups and makes this coffee even more inviting!!!  I definitely recommend as a staple daily coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
positive,The Keurig cups always had something missing. They reminded me of coffee but always tasted a little funny. I really do think it's all the plastic surrounding the coffee. I didn't get much use out of my Keurig until I found this coffee. I am reordering today!
positive,"Fantastic Coffee, at a a fraction of the price of the freeze dried Keurig K-cup's, all of which are made by the same company, with the same tasteless coffee bean, no matter what the name of the coffee.  I can't imagine paying a dollar a cup for a ""donut house"" k-cup that is made of Folgers.  What a joke."
positive,"I love this coffee. I started buying it in the grocery store, but this is a lot cheaper at Amazon. Rich, flavorful, and smells just like I ground the beans myself. Going to re-order right now."
positive,"When I got my Keurig, I couldn't wait to get my favorite Starbucks coffee in K Cups. When I saw this, I liked the design of the cup and the price is much better too. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Doing a side by side comparison, Fog Chaser wins hands down! If you like a bold cup that lingers on your tongue and hold up under creamer too (I use unsweetened coconut milk), you will be happy you tried this coffee. Oh! A huge added bonus of the new environmentally friendly K Cup design is that you get that heavenly coffee aroma from the minute you open the vacuum sealed bag! You don't have to wait until its brewing to ""wake up and smell the coffee!"" :)"
positive,"Personally, I received this product by going down the list of K-Cups trying to find that perfect cup to put on scheduled delivery.  This is a nice bold coffee, and oddly fiscal.  I personally like the first brew, and the house mate likes the second and third, now THAT is a good deal."
positive,Bought this product however it doesnt seem like a great way to keep the coffee airtight. I tried the other K-cup similar cups and they seem to keep it fresher.
positive,This is a robust roast. Definitely a morning coffee.  We love the flavor and the value! Be sure to store in an airtight container to maintain the flavor.
positive,I have tried 5 or 6 different brands and found this brand to be the better one. I am sticking with this for now.
positive,"First time trying SF coffee and found it to be a good coffee with a reasonable taste. Yes, the coffee smells burned prior to use but I believe thatunless you are a  connoisseur of coffee I believe most might smelled ""burnt"".  Good coffee for the price and the ""K-Cup"" new packaging works just as well as the original stle K-Cup packaging. I believe I will try another brand for taste but would stay with SFbay if the price were 5 cents less per cup.  I drink alot of coffee.!!"
negative,"Not the coffee for us. Very strong. Did the subscribe and save, for got to cancel the next shipment, went to and complete the return forms- No such luck. Great idea, just tastes awful. First item that I could not return, back to buy coffee at QVC, they will take it back if we do not like it."
positive,This coffee was really good Fogchaser will get you going. It's a strong bold cup of coffee.  This cofee is valued price with a great taste!
positive,"Decided to give these a try based on price.  The coffee tastes great but since the 'cups' don't have the plastic bottoms (a filter element), we had to store in a sealed jar to keep them fresh and not have the coffee bean smell thru-out the house.  (or you could use a plastic ziploc - original bag was not re-sealable).  They did one thing finally right - you don't have to pay MORE for going green when buying LESS packaging.  Kudos."
positive,i dont no what the big fuss is about a lot of bad reviews but if u read the description you shoulld no it comes revealed and not in plastic like regualr kcups anyhow i ordered the fogchaser and they were great i amade iced coffee with mine and the flavor was perfect i just keep it in some tupperware to keep fresh is all i plan on buying all 3 flavors and encourage they should come out with even more flavors the price is awsome beats paying 15 bucks for 18 kucps when i just paid 14 for 36 kcups i will def keep on buying these
negative,"25 lbs. of hard licorice pieces were dumped into kitchen trash bags, unsealed, then put into a cardboard box.  The most disgusting, unsanitary packaging I've ever seen.  I tossed the entire thing in the trash.<br />To top it off, the first ingredient in the whole thing was corn syrup.  Yuk.<br />Avoid like the plague."
positive,"Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that."
positive,My son loves all the food by earths best but would like to mention that it's way cheaper buying in store than amazon. Amazon charges 2 - 3$ more than stores.
positive,"We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food."
positive,"My daughter loves the entire Earths Best line.  I taste everything before I feed it to her and each item tastes pure and fresh.  Very happy.  We've tasted other popular name brands, and Earths Best is really good in comparison."
positive,I tried all kinds of oatmeal to give my LO but this is her favorite one. I also love the fact that it comes on time.
positive,If I had only figured out to order baby food online before.  The price is right on the money and the convenience of the shipping to the house is great.  No need to go to the store and have baby jars flying all over the cart.  This flavor is my baby's favorite.  It's a go to when she is not in the mood for anything else.
negative,"I love Earth's Best products and only use them to feed my baby, besides home made foods. I rate this one one star because the seller didn't specify that this product contains milk, which my baby cannot tolerate since he is lactose-intolerant. So for us, it was a waste of money, and I bought two packs..."
negative,"This baby food, labeled for 6+ months, contains heavy cream. My baby could not digest it; we had a very bad day. Maybe I missed that in the description, but in any case, everywhere I've read and according to my pediatrician, you're supposed to avoid cow's milk products before age 1 (why they make formula using cow's milk and not a much more digestible milk like goat baffles me and is a rant for another time--my son drinks the lactose free kind, in any case). I ordered another variety of ""Wholesome breakfast"" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them."
positive,"My daughter likes it now, but when she was younger she did not want to have it! Go figure! Now she is almost 14 months she digs the flavor."
negative,My son hated it. I tasted some and saw why. It's tart and the barley gives it a weird smell and flavor. Yuck!
negative,I wish Amazon would include a list of ingredients on baby food in bulk. This has cream in it and my baby has a cow's milk intolerance. I had already opened the jar when I read the ingredients and now I'm stuck with 15 jars of food I can't use. So disappointing.
positive,"Price was great, variety, flavor was good, baby likes it! She takes a while to eat, but it's safe and clean to leave in the refrigerator."
positive,Great baby foods!  I like the variety pack.  Much cheaper than buying it from the local grocers or co-op!  I Just wish they came in the squeezie pouches!
positive,I love how it's thicker than other Stage 2 baby food. My son gobbles it down! Way better than the lunch or dinner varities!
positive,"This is one of my sons favorites. Even though it's called ""wholesome breakfast"" he usually has this for lunch. It is packed with nutrients, including 35% of his daily iron. This is a staple in our baby's diet!"
positive,"We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  Also, our baby is a picky eater, so we're thrilled to find something she likes that's more substantial than Puffs!"
positive,I enjoy most of the Yogi teas but this particular one tastes almost sinful. I don't know that it necessarily tastes a lot like vanilla or hazelnut but it has a very delicious spicy taste.
positive,"I bought 4 high end dry foods that my miniature poodle simply would not eat. I tried mixing it with canned food and broth, but she'd lick off the canned food and leave the kibble. I was worried that she wasn't getting the nutrients she needed. Then I found Utramix and I am thrilled. She loves it, actually cleans her bowl. I merely drizzle a little warm water on it since I'm no longer mixing in canned food and she gobbles it up. There are chunks of bananas, peas, carrots, etc. that she seems to love. The mix even contains probiotics. Highly recommended."
positive,A extremly healthy plant that has grown dramatically since its arrival. It should be an exceptional plant for blooming if it casts blooms as readily as it grows vegatatively. I have high expectations for this one!
positive,About 10 years ago while visiting disneyworld in orlando florida my wife and I met a nice english couple. Being a tea drinker I inquired about good english teas and they gave me a napkin with the names of bewleys tea on it and about 6 teabags for me to try. I put the napkin in my back pocket and the teabags got wrapped up in an old sandwich bag and put in my wife's purse. We parted with the nice english couple and as we traveled around disneyworld it began to rain that afternoon and we got soaking wet. I found what was left of the napkin that evening at the hotel and it was unreadable. About 6 months later at home the bag fell out of my tea closet as i was fixing to make a cup and I decided to finally try the tea those nice folks from england raved about. I loved the tea and I believe I have finally found it in bewleys. Some of the best tea I have had. The english surely know their tea.
positive,"I have been drinking Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea until I tried Bewley's.  I have always like my tea very strong using double the amount of most people.  I drink it with cream and sugar and this tea is perfect for me.  I do not have to put in extra because it is full bodied and stands up to cream and sugar wonderfully.  I have been drinking it in the morning and have been using the Yorkshire Gold for the afternoon. Bewley's is my favorite now, not that Yorkshire Gold sucks or anything but I like it strong.  I will still search for another tea perhaps as good. Life is an adventure and you never know when you're going to bingo.<br /><br />If you like a strong, not bitter brew try Bewley's!  After you've had Irish it is hard to go back, teawise that is."
negative,"Recently purchased these treats for my 4 dogs from local grocery store. After giving my dogs these chews, my 3 month old puppy threw up the treat. By the next day at lunch time, he was exhibiting neurotoxic symptoms. We immediately took him to the vet for blood work, which all came back below normal limits. He was given IV therapy and monitored over night. Over the next two days, my older dogs (ages 4, 7 and 9)began vomiting and acting lethargic, but with no neurological symptoms. We traced the cause back to these chews, as it is the only coomon thing among all the dogs (puppy eats different food than adult dogs, puppy is walked on a leash not allowed to run around in yard yet, puppy is not out of his crate unless he is beig observed, etc.). After speaking with someone at a pet store, we learned some rawhide chews are pressed with water, while others are pressed with formaldehyde. While it is not listed which method these use, we are concerned it is the formaldehyde. In the case of the older dogs, their GIs are rejecting them due to the toxins. With the puppy, his immature renal and hepatic system exhibited neurotoxicity."
positive,"I ordered these tails a while back for my Parents to be shipped to St. George, Utah. The customer service and express shipping were excellent. The tails were recieved on time and still frozen. The best part is the tails are very large and sometimes from other sources, I have recieved tails this size that were ""Soft"" and not firm meat. These were fantastic and were saved up to 3-4 months with a couple retrived from the freezer and broiled....perfectly every time..Thank<br />s for the great product and service!!"
negative,"I confirm another review here that perfectly describes the texture and taste of this product as like chewing on a cellulose sponge! OMG! I love tofu, by the way. This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.<br /><br />I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think ""sponge"" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good."
negative,"If you feel compelled to buy this, get it from Whole Foods so you don't waste money buying the 6 pack. Buyer beware that you cannot return many food items. The texture of this after rehydration was like a cellulose sponge.If you must have dehydrated tofu for hiking or camping trips, make your own or buy the tofu in the sealed boxes.  On the flip side, I love many of Eden products but this was a waste of my money."
positive,"Koya Dofu, or freeze-dried tofu, requires a specific approach to cooking. It not only has to be rehydrated in a particular way, but also will not taste good without proper cooking to flavor and soften it. Even at that point, it will have a chewy, slightly spongey texture, but if cut and cooked appropriately, it is not a strange texture and is very delicious as a side dish.<br /><br />Google recipes for Koyadofu and try one that involves simmering it (after rehydration) in a broth made of katsuobushi (if you are not vegetarian -- if you are, then use mushroom or vegie stock), shouyu or tamari, mirin, and a little sweetner. My child loves this, and I pack it in her school lunch box along with rice, and some vegies that have been simmered in the same broth."
negative,"We'd been buying the four-pack of Melitta French Vanilla coffee once a month for the past 2 years. We won't be any more. In the last month they changed their packaging, which is fine, but also changed the grind. All of a sudden, these four packs come in ""extra fine grind,"" which simply doesn't work well at all in our drip coffee maker. The whole pot tastes weak until you get to the last couple of cups, which taste more like mud because all of the coffee has settled. Here's hoping they switch back at some point, because this is just bad."
positive,"I have been a big Starbucks fan for a long time now, but thought I would try something that I could do the subscribe and save deal on. I chose this one because of the great reviews and thought it would make a change to have a flavored coffee. I am so glad I did! I love it. It is so smooth and the aroma when you open the can is wonderful. Can't wait to try the other types of Melitta coffee now too."
positive,"I am a fan of Melitta's other coffees, especially hazelnut, but they just didn't get French Vanilla right. There is something of a chemical aftertaste to it that contradicts the nice aroma. It's noticeable enough to make you wonder if something is ""not quite right"" with it. Not disgusting, you can definitely get through your cup but not delicious either."
positive,"I was a little apprehensive about ordering coffee online.  I had never heard of this brand, but to my delight, it is absolutely delicious.  I love it and my husband enjoys the Vanilla and also one of the other blends.  I would recommend if you are fan of any flavored coffee."
negative,I thought these were going to be the same size as the ones in the grocery store. I found they were smaller and more expensive to buy online then if I just bought the bigger ones for 99 cents each at the grocery store.
negative,"$23.52 for ten pounds of these beans???  I just bought a bag of these at Sam's Club for $8.95.  If you want to pay nearly 4 times the going rate, by ALL MEANS, purchase this!  Seriously, how STUPID would a person need to be to pay $2.53 for a pound of dried beans?"
positive,I like variety in my gf cereals and this granola is a nice addition to my shelf. The granola comes in packets inside the box so it is handy for travel. It's sweet but not too sweet. I eat it in a bowl with milk and it is just the right amount. Granola is more dense so a portion is smaller than a bowl full of cereal.
positive,"I've been eating Glutenfreeda's Granola for breakfast the past two months and I love it!<br />especially the individual packaging, keeps it fresh."
positive,Glutenfreeda's gluten free granola is an ideal breakfast food for people who have to eat gluten free.  It also makes an on the road snack that is easy to pack in your purse or carry on luggage.  The oats in it are guarrenteed to be gluten free.
negative,Although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod.  The cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery.
positive,The Parisian Cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the Senseo machine.  The box advertises universal fit but it is not.
positive,"Coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic. Fits perfectly in out ""Juan Valdez"" pod maker that was purchased at Target several years ago! So hard to find these so was glad to find them on Amazon!"
positive,"Smooth coffee, but a bit to big for senseo, interestingly all the other Melitta One pod flavors fit just fine in senseo, my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze."
negative,My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.
positive,Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price.
positive,"Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets!"
positive,"My mom has the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and was using Senseo pods in it. They were too strong / bitter for her and I was searching for something else.  Found these and Wolfgang Puck's and decided to get both for her.  These Melitta Breakfast Blend pods are her favorite! She says they have a smooth taste and great flavor. Granted, neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone (I don't even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing), but she really likes these and is happy to have them."
negative,To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf.<br />What happened to Senseo decaf?
negative,"This coffee .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0508Y"">Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)</a> is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee."
positive,Melitta Pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. Buyer Beware: Pods vary GREATLY in the amount of coffee they have in them. These allow for a good size cup of coffee.
negative,"I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee."
positive,"A decent, clean, and simple cup of morning decaf. I find pre-wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor."
positive,just the greatest thing when you have your favorite coffee at such a fair price deliverd right to your door :) I will be doing this again. Thank you !
positive,"I only buy Fromm for my dog. He loves it and I feel good about feeding it to him.  No fillers, the first ingredient is meat/fish.  This seller had a more than fair price and shipping was faster than I expected.  I would definitely buy from them again!"
positive,This product is great!  I can't seem to find it locally at my pet food stores and it's worth feeding my pet the best!!  Super fast delivery from this seller!
positive,"The hazelnut flavor is unique.  I'm glad Amazon has decided to carry them, because they are hard to find locally."
positive,"Hands down this is absolutely the best kona coffee I have ever had in my life..This is the smoothest and richest coffee you will ever have...Go ahead and spoil yourself, you'll be glad you did!!"
positive,"I can see why plenty of people will think this is the best coffee ever. It's some of the smoothest, least bitter coffee I've ever tasted. The aroma is also delicious. Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though."
negative,"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again."
positive,"I'm more of a tea drinker but occasionally want something different and I like this to keep me up or wake me up too. So, keep in mind I haven't tasted lots of coffees. I find most coffees bitter and gross, like starbucks or whatever my mom buys. With some splenda I actually enjoy this, so even if you don't like coffee give this a try. It's definitely one of the better one."
positive,"This coffee is the absolute best.  I found it by accident a couple of months ago and now I can not have any other kind of coffee.  It may be more expensive than some, but well worth it.  Plus, you aren't going to want to go out to Starbucks anymore!  Manufacturer ships quickly too!"
positive,Pretty good coffee I really liked it<br />It is a bit on the strong side or it may be the way I brewed it but it is a good tasting coffee in my opinion.
negative,"Product looked and smelled great - however, it was not clear from the description that this product is for non-ESE pod machines. I like the idea of organic and US source, this just didn't work for me."
positive,This was purchased for my daughter and her husband.  I was very pleased with the selection of items in the basket.
positive,"These crackers make a handy quick snack on the go or at my desk.  I do wish that the mix was four of the cheese filled crackers and four peanut butter rather than two cheese and six peanut butter, which is why I only gave it four stars.  But I like the taste and convenience so much that I have this on auto-ship monthly.  And I like having some variety, which is why I order the variety pack instead of all the same flavor."
positive,love these little crackers and a great price on these will be ordering from this vendor again expiration on these was bout 6 months away
positive,Fast delivery by Amazon.<br /><br />I've always liked Keebler products and think these are good. I use them for a quick easy feed. My dog also likes them and recommends them to other dogs.
positive,"Just had this for the first time at PF Chang's in Sacramento yesterday.  I was utterly amazed at how good it is and I am a tough critic, having been a long-time Earl Grey lover.  It's great with food because the taste is light and refreshing; it's also delicious, by the way.  It's perfect for summertime, perfect frosty cold with lots of ice.  And it's real tea, not a powder.  It smells so good I almost want to wear it! Can you tell?  I LOVE this tea!"
positive,"We eat at PF Changs fairly often and love the jasmine blackberry tea they serve. Looked all over for something like it, found China Mist and are delighted that it is the exact, same tea!"
positive,"We drink a lot of tea in our house.  It is the drink of choice for lunch and dinner with both myself and my husband and our oldest son.  This blackberry jasmine tea is wonderful.  It tastes very much like the Jasmine blackberry tea we get at PF Chang's restaurant.  I don't know if it is the same but it tastes very simliar.  I add just a touch of sugar which seems to bring out the flavors so much.  If you are a tea drinker who appreciates flavors other than the typical, this is a wonderful product.  Also, the service was fast and accurate.  We will definitely be purchasing this again when we run out."
positive,"I gave up diet coke last year. I drink water but it gets old after a while. I don't like sweet tea, but I do like to have a little flavor. This is has such a wonderful, light flavor. Even my kids like this tea! I've been stocking up so that I have plenty at all times!"
positive,"A friend of mine got me started drinking unsweetened green tea at Starbucks, and I fell in love with it.  It was delicious.  Because I enjoyed it so much, I ordered green tea when some coworkers took me to lunch at Kona in Baltimore Inner Harbor.  It was SO good, it blew the Starbucks stuff out of the water.  We eat at Kona a lot, and I always drink so much of the tea that I feel like I'm sloshing when I leave.  It's so rare that I find a drink that I enjoy sipping ... not just guzzling it down because I'm thirsty.<br /><br />Today, I finally asked the server which brand they serve, though I didn't have hopes of finding it in consumer size containers (I assumed they'd be buying from direct-to-restaurant suppliers).  I am SO thrilled to find that it's accessible.  And cheaply at that!  I'm about to order several of these to keep myself pleasantly stocked in the house.  this stuff is delightful."
positive,I have only tried the Strawberry and it was suprisingly good. Some after-taste as would be expected but really good otherwise. I use this to supplement my workouts.
positive,"After being on a low-carb diet for the past few months, I was desperate for something sweet.  These almonds were like HEAVEN!  They were just what the doctor ordered and just a handful satisfied my craving for sweets.  I now eat a few after dinner every night and don't feel like I'm missing anything.  They are sweetened with Sucralose so they fit into the low-carb diet.  I liked them so well that I'm going to try the chocolate ones.  I'm also going to crush some up and put it in my ""lite"" vanilla yogurt for a granola like breakfast.  I highly recommend them!"
negative,26 dollars to ship 2 loaves of bread?  I can go to the grocery store and get like 12 loaves for this price.
negative,I purchased this sauce at a local grocery store this afternoon. I opened it and gave it a quick taste. Absolutely no flavor to be realized . I don't know why a company would put out such a bland product when spices to repair the taste are readily available. This is a bad product. Buy something else.
negative,"I'd label this as flavored water, but bottled water has more flavor. I noticed when I poured it into a sauce pan for heating it up, almost half, maybe more, was just water. Upon actually eating it, I couldn't help but notice what little bit of flavor there was tasted like regular olive oil (as opposed to the ""Extra Virgin olive oil listed in the ingredients). I'd like to think it was a bad batch, but even then you'd think quality control was better than that. Either way, I'd recommend buying a single container locally and trying that before buying a bulk quantity."
positive,"I wasn't sure how many nuts were going to be in this package. I just wanted a few, but there are over a dozen nuts in this package. I have given many away to friends and family. There is a brief description about the use of the outer layer for mace and the inner kernel for the nutmeg. If you don't have a need for so much nutmeg, it makes a great gift for the other cooks in your cirle of friends."
positive,I was very pleased with the quality of this this product plus the cost. I could not have done so well in the super markets.<br />Thank you Amazon.
negative,SERIOUSLY PEOPLE ???<br /><br />$7.00 S&H on a $3.00 product ?????<br /><br />250% of the product price for SHIPPING ????<br /><br />I have had heavy text books delivered for WAY less
positive,"The Capri Sun Lemonade drink puches are very handy and good tasting. My kids really like the flavor and we like that it is controlled amount of drink.<br /><br />The pouch comes with a straw that has a pointy end to puncture the pouch. It is easy to make it ""spout"" if you squeeze the pouch, so little kids might need adult help.<br /><br />Very convenient and highly recommended!"
positive,"I picked up a bottle of this unique soda at JIM'S APPLE FARM - an awesome seasonal store located in southern MN.  Seeing as today is ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008M7HGAA"">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>,"" and the bottle's artwork has a nice skull and crossbones motif, it only seemed fitting to share this crazy beverage with co-workers.  I pried open the bottle and took a sniff, wherein I noticed a slightly herbal scent; considering the long list of herbal ingredients on the label, this wasn't particularly suprising.  I then poured the nearly blood red elixir into a cup and took an initial swallow.  I was rather suprised by the initial bitterness of the soda; it definitely wasn't what I was expecting!  Continuing with a couple more swallows, I then started to notice a slight burning sensation in my esophagus -- this, no doubt, came from the jalape&ntilde;o oil that was infused into the beverage.  I wasn't sure if I liked this soda at first.  However, the more that I drank it, the more that I came to enjoy this bizarre concoction.  It also seemed to cure my morning craving for caffeine, so that was pretty cool too.  My co-workers weren't so thrilled with this beverage, but I thought that it was pretty good. At the very least, it makes for good discussion as a novelty item."
positive,"Brain Wash (as well as all the other Skeleteen drinks) are mind-bogglingly nostalgic from the first sip! From what I can tell, this company is no longer in production. I highly recommend trying this amazing soda before it's too late!"
negative,"sounded interesting with some okay ingredients,but... package arrived with four out of twelve bottles broken...also, the taste is just a little too unique. I still have bottles left and I can't even give them away. And the blue color is so intense your tongue will stay blue for days.(and so will your BM's)"
negative,"I can not find these Cella Milk Chocolate Covered Cherries in local retail stores.  So I ordered these online.  I was surprised to receive them so quickly.  I had them 2 days after I ordered and I ordered on a Sunday.  However, once I opened them and ate a few I am disappointed.  The liquid center in these candies is gone and the cherries inside are all dried up.  Somehow the liquid filling either evaporated are just dried up as there is no sticky evidence of leaking in the box.  Also, the milk chocolate has a chalky look as if it has oxidized.  We can still eat them as they are okay, but they are not as advertized on the outside of the box as containing a clear liquid center.  I think it's obvious that these Chocolates are just very old and probably have exceeded their optimum shelf life.  I will not order from this reseller again."
negative,The first thing I noticed was an odd smell. That dissipated after a half hour or so. Off to a bad start. But I was willing to try one. It was sticky. The wrappers clearly had a layer of the cream filling all over the outsides.<br />In fact half of them were sticky. There was the source of the smell. There is no indication any of them were damaged and leaked that might have caused the stickiness. There are three levels separated by a sheet of cardboard but no stickiness on the cardboard. Because of all that they were sticky before they were put into the box.<br />Never again.
positive,Especially now that they included the warning about pits on the box. A. You know they are using real cherries and B. You could bite into a pit so chew carefully.
positive,"Suffice it to say that no other chocolate covered cherries are as good as Cella's.  These have been my favorite for many, many years."
positive,"If you like Huckleberries, this one is for you, just grab a spoon (like we did) and skip the toast.  Our only complaint, not enough . . . we placed another order 2 days later."
positive,"This past season was my first sugaring experience.  I was happy with this filter, it took out a lot of sediment and crystals for a pretty nice syrup. I would wet the filter with warm water before running the warm syrup through it and it worked effectively. This is tall and skinny and I didn't have anything to really hold it up, so actually filtering took a bit of coordination.  I somewhat wish I had a shorter fatter filter, but haven't seen any out there. I cleaned it quickly each time I used it, but by the end of the season with the darker syrup it did get some staining. I will consider getting the filter liners for next season and maybe something that will hold it in place for me (if that exists)."
positive,This filter did a great job on my small backyard operation.  After running my syrup through it I didn't have any sentimentation.
positive,I LOVE BANANA TAFFY! and it's hard to find. I recieved my taffy petty fast and it did my craving! No I'm not pregnant. Just LOVE!!! I would work with this buyer again! Excellent to do business with!

positive,"I first became exposed to these when my husband's aunt sent some to the family from England.  His parents had grown up on them, but we don't get these in the U.S. even though Nestle now owns the brand.  If you like toffee candies, you have to get this!!  I am seriously addicted to half of the candies in this assortment and ordered one tub for his family for Christmas and other for just the two of us!"
positive,Quality Street chocolates are a Xmas tradition in many families. I must have them during the holidays or it is not the same. They have become very difficult to find in the US over the last few years but thank god for Amazon!<br />Try a bottle and get your favorites. My friends are addicted!
positive,Pretty much the title says it. Might try Celebrations or Roses next year - we did all those when we lived there.... I believe this was the most economical when I looked this year.
positive,These chocolates are the best but unfortunately they are not easy to find in the US as they are European. The product was very fresh and tasted amazing!
positive,Thank you sooooo much for carrying this product.  My wife and I recently spent a year in the United Kingdom and we both developed quite a sweet tooth for a number of products while there.<br />Her one main gift request for Christmas was a container of quality street.  Thank you for helping to make her Christmas come true.<br />I would definitely recommend this seller.<br />Item arrived in great time even with massive snow delays before it even left the UK.<br />Thank you again.!!
positive,5MM Pink Edible Pearls are a wonderful addition to cakes & cookies!  They can instantly add sophistication to any piece!
positive,"These are my favorite snack right now. Crunchy, tangy, a tiny bit hot... Altogether delicious. These are even better paired with a bag of pretzels!"
positive,"I love Fizzies, and find them best, when broken into three or four pieces, then I put one piece in a glass of regular soda pop. which makes it fizzier! It's all about the fizz!"
negative,"A diluted hot sauce derived from the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. A 5 oz bottle is far too small given its diluted nature. You might use close to a bottle for a single family sized meal.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed, in this order, from the product label): Water, acetic acid, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, carrots, sugar, ...etc<br /><br />Tasting notes - diluted heat along with a heavy vinegar taste and, at best, a vague jalape&ntilde;o flavor.  The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one. The vinegar taste is over powering. Note that the second ingredient (after water) is acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar)!<br /><br />I'd recommend the El Yucateco Hot Jalape&ntilde;o Hot sauce which uses the same Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but it has a much purer and fresher taste. I love the Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but this sauce does not feature its fine qualities very well.<br /><br />PS - As should be evident -- I enjoy taste testing hot sauces and writing up my results. I've tried about 50 different ones to date. I try very hard to describe flavor notes and list the actual ingredients."
positive,"I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says ""Very Hot"", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called ""Bufalo"" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff."
positive,"If you are looking for a strong and robust cup of coffee, look no further.<br />Every time I brew a cup I get a reaction from people near by.<br />You can even run the same bag twice into one cup to get a slightly weaker cup of coffee....it's still eye opening however!<br />Brew On"
positive,"This stuff is never cheap, but this is less expensive than the Flavia website and I really like this coffee.  When the Flavia machine breaks down I will not be ordering another as there are more varieties with a Keureg and the coffee can be found everywhere"
positive,"I have used this product for years. It has lots of flavor and resembles and feels like real honey. The down-side of this product is the gas ""problem"" when you eat excess (???) amounts of it. I use it in place of Karo syrup to make almond-crusted pecan pies. It produces an ""okay"" pie. However, I eat large slices of this pecan pie and that causes the gas ""problem"". I bought bottles of Nature's Hollow and Natrazyle Kosher substitutes for side-by-side comparison with Honey Tree. Although neither caused a gas ""problem"", I believe both are lacking in flavor and the Natrazyle appeared to have a slimy ""mouth-feel"". I will try each of these in a pecan pie and if I believe either of the pies is better than the Honey Tree pie, I will report back."
negative,"Having been diagnosed diabetic I really miss all the heavy duty sweets to which I was accustomed.  My father and my husband were both beekeepers so I know what real honey should taste like.  This product definitely does not live up to anything resembling that taste.  True, it is sweet, and I must admit serves a purpose of sorts, but as for tasting anything like honey - no, it definitely does NOT.  I once made a 9x12 pan of baklava and ate all of it (except one small piece eaten by my husband) in 3-4 days - so, I know whereof I speak."
positive,"I noticed a difference between the quality of this matcha and a much more expensive variety.  I am currently a matcha neophyte but I noticed that the expensive matcha tasted significantly better, seemed more fresh, and had a better brighter color.  I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area."
positive,"I love this product.<br />I had a chance to drink green tea latte at Starbucks.<br />But, Starbucks green tea latte is very expensive.<br />So, I try to make green tea latte myself and I find out they use Matcha.<br />Everyday I made my own green tea latte for me and my wife.<br />She really likes it.<br />Fortunately, I found same product at local store with price $5.99."
negative,"Ujinotsuyu Matcha Hagoromo is not nearly as good as some of the other brands of matcha I tried. Instead of being a pure green, it had a faint yellow-brownish tinge. It was also quite harsh and bitter-flavored. If you're willing to spend more money but don't want expensive tea ceremony grade matcha, try Do Matcha 2nd Harvest (the red label variety). It has a much lighter and fresher flavor. My local store also carries Maeda-en, which is better than Ujinotsuyu but not as good as Do Matcha."
positive,"This tea is premium.  Don't accept green tea in bags; it is less tasty and probably less healthy.<br /><br />Here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful:<br /><br />* cancer<br />* rheumatoid arthritis<br />* high cholesterol levels<br />* cariovascular disease<br />* infection<br />* impaired immune function<br /> * acne, omg.<br /><br />And drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits!"
positive,"I like using this matcha for latte smoothies and so far it has been yummy.  Saves me $$$ at the coffee shop, because now I make my own."
negative,"I found the matcha to be very bitter and grainy. I had few bowls but it ended up being used to cookies which were very tasty. Also made some smoothies with honey added and they were a hit.<br />I didnt buy from amazon. I got mine from a tea shop in chinatown for $5/can. I wanted to see if you really get what you pay for.<br />I have been buying my matcha directly from japan(yuuki-cha, ippodo,o-cha) and i dont think its fair to compare since they cost $20-30/can.<br />if you are looking for a serious drinking tasteful matcha stay away from this one. But as culinary grade matcha its certainly a good value."
negative,"When I received it and soon after opened it, the matcha appears a pale green, as if it has been sitting in storage too long before they sent it. DoMatcha, on the other hand, when I first bought it was bright green and fresher.<br /><br />Not into this brand --  I prefer DoMatcha. . ."
negative,"Being new to matcha, I bought two types to sample, this and the ingredient grade matcha from MatchaSource. I opened the MatchaSource one first and found it delicious, bright green, lovely flavour, dissolves well if you follow the instructions and dissolve in a little hot water before adding the milk. Then I tried this one, and was quite disappointed, the powder is sage green in colour, produces a grey-brown tea with very little flavour and the powder never quite dissolves.  Not at all what I was expecting given my experience with the MatchaSource tea. Between the two, this will not be the one that I buy again. Nice tin, though."
negative,"I made a cup of my usual..using preheated steamed frothed milk, this ""maccha"" green tea powder  and sometimes a little Stevia. YUCK.<br /><br />I paid $14.99 at an Asian store for this. The Eden $36 a can was much much much better...you can get that $27 or $29 a can in bulk.  I've ordered some stuff from Japan..Ryu-Mei. I'll let you know how this works out when it arrives.<br /><br />I guess if you just want to add powder to regular tea to make yourself feel better about the added health benefits this would be ok. If you hate the green twiggy matcha taste, this is ok.<br /><br />This is probably ok as ingredient grade. Or if you like iced tea...<br /><br />This is a sage green powder color ground very fine.<br />Tastes like ground BROWN tea. YUCK.<br />Nothing like the ""Green"" in Eden's Spring matcha.<br /><br />The tin comes with a bag inside and a preservative (oxygen destroyer pack). You open the bag when you are ready to serve. Then dump the contents in the tin.<br /><br />To each his own, this is not for me."
positive,"but the previous reviewer doesn't know that with his ""jittery"" comments.  He loves looking at what he writes on products he knows nothing about and doesn't even try.  Never helpful but allways full of himself, and all that for your pleasure!  All for the price of nothing.... and thats what its worth."
positive,"This was my first tea purchase for our Keurig machine, and I am very pleased. The flavor was smooth - no bitterness at all. Drank it hot, and over ice - both were fantastic. I will be buying this again."
positive,"We love this tea, especially when it's made into ice tea.  We just brew it over ice and presto!  You can add sweetener - or not.  It's a great summer drink."
positive,"I am not a HUGE tea fan, I'm a coffee drinker. But I do like green tea, and this is a nice and easy way to get green tea!"
negative,"I purchased this tea along with several other kcup varieties for a coffee maker that gets occasional use.  Unfortunatley, the expiration date on the Celestial Green Decaf Tea purchased here on Amazon is within one month.  I know I will be throwing away most of this tea because it will expire before it is used.  All the other kcups purchased have at least one year before they expire.<br /><br />The shipping to return the tea would have cost half the price of the tea.  I don't think I will purchase any more food items on Amazon."
positive,I'm on the 17 Day diet and drink this tea at least 3 times a day. I love it. Perfect for the large cup size on th K. It's also one of the few decaf teas offered that doesn't have a funky taste. it's a staple for me. I highly recommend it.
positive,"I love these single serve cups, no steeping, so easy to use, would recommend to everyone. Very affordable, great tasting."
positive,"Celestial Seasonings has long been one of my favorite brands, and the caffeine-free green tea has a good, strong flavor.  I like it with a dab of honey. With the Keurig cups, it couldn't be easier to have a hot cup of tea in the afternoon.  Keurig isn't the least expensive way to go, for sure.  Much higher than tea bags.  But it makes a flavorful cup of whatever you brew - tea, coffee, mochas, cider. It's all good."
positive,While I do love to shop on Amazon and do ( I love it too much ). The Kcups are less expensive on the Keurig web site. One of the very few things that cost less elsewhere.
positive,"I bought this for my dad as a gift, he loved it, and my parents said it was very pretty also. I like to give them gifts that they can nibble on, as they have about everything else one could imagine. Gifts like this one can at least be consumed. Good gift and glad to have this kind of option."
positive,"POP ROCKS 36 packs Strawberry Sold by candymachines/<br />Penguinmints Thru Amazon, & Free Super Saving Shipping...<br />  They are so fresh & they Definitely pop great<br />in your mouth, & they taste great also.. YUM, YUM..<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00155UY3W"">Pop Rocks 36 Packs Strawberry</a>"
negative,"i have put more than a few gingerbread houses together with my kids and this was buy far the worst experience i have EVER had with one. do not waste your money on this pile of garbage. they use the Barbie name to draw you in and then nothing fits together, the directions are horrible and the house itself it tiny. from now on i will stick with a no name brand gingerbread house. my wife just left to buy a REAL GB house and i have just finished throwing this piece of garbage where it belongs....in the trash.<br /><br />one good thing....the kids were are eating it, so its tasty."
negative,One star is too generous. I love the tea and hate the seller. I ordered 6 packs of twining tea. The first seller I chose had a 6 pack and each pack with 20 bags. The next search was for the same deal and it even listed as a 6 pack. Now that I got the package I see it's one lousy box of 20 bags for more than $19. What an incredible rip off. Last time for Shaqdis Books and Marketplace for me.
positive,"I was most distressed when I discovered my local grocery store was no longer going to carry this tea; how was I going to get through my evenings without it? Then the light bulb went on & I thought ""I'll get it from Amazon!"" Shipping was very fast & now I have a good supply in my cupboard. When I run out, I know where it order it next time."
positive,"Since I am a teetotaler, I haven't tried this in the various cocktails where it is featured (just search the 'net for recipes). I love bitters in club soda. This product has a VERY intense lavender flavor, and I personally found that it was almost too floral to be drunk with soda. I did add some orange bitters and that helped. I think that these bitters will be perfect in cooking (I'm thinking lavender ice cream...) and perhaps as an herbal component, much like lavender in herbs de provence. If you love lavender you will very pleased. A little goes a long ways, so this bottle will last and last."
positive,"A few years ago we received a gift of salt someone brought us from Hawaii.  A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I've been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I'd try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don't get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It's a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don't get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it's nothing or simply too much.  I know, I'm giving a lot of words here.  It's just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven't found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it's either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I'm tossing it in the garbage because it's too much a pain at meal time when I'm trying to figure it out.  I can't say it's awful because maybe it's us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don't get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I'll take a stand and say - we don't like it.  I've tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton's course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii..."
positive,"I've been using this red sea salt for a few years when i work (I'm a chef). The flavor is really bright and enhances quite a few dishes, from meats to veggies and even desserts. I decided to buy some for my home recently here. I find it is better used as a finisher, i.e.  sprinkled on foods. I also use it in seafood rubs quite often. My favorite uses are sprinkled on fresh veggies such as cucumber slices and heirloom tomatoes, on chocolate/caramel dishes, and used with seafood. I have several salts, so i generally use this for those three purposes, but sometimes, I'll add it to other dishes as well. It doesnt really dissolve quickly (probably due to the red clay which gives it its color), so it is better used in dishes where that isnt an expectation. Otherwise, it is multifunctional and i think you'll like it. Enjoy!"
positive,"I bought this salt and the black lava salt for my husband, who is the chef in the family. Both are delicious, with different flavors that are appropriate in different settings. He's having a great time determining all those settings, and I'm having a great time tasting his results.<br /><br />The salts came with a note from the company and a free sample of some candy; it was a very friendly and pleasant introduction to the company. They also arrived quickly, in plenty of time for the gift-giving occasion for which I needed them."
positive,"Im not sure what it should taste like, But I think it has a clay taste.<br /><br />The kalua pig turned out great! which is why the salt was purchased.. Now the 3 stars comes due to amount of salt at such a high price. But try finding this at walmart!"
positive,"I love the flavor of this beautiful, corally colored, sea salt. Another teriffic finishing salt what adds color and a light sea flavor to any dish."
positive,I'll add another 5 star review!  I absolutely love this salt.  I even bring this salt with me when I go to restaurants (I have a small salt grinder).  BUY IT.
positive,"Alaea sea salt contains traces of red clay from the Hawaiian pools where it is condensed. That explains its color, its slowness to dissolve, and its flavor. I have no idea whether the clay adds any nutritional value to the salt, but it has a certain Biblical resonance. ""Clay thou art, Adam!"" In fact, the name 'adam' is derived from the Hebrew word for clay.<br /><br />This is the only 'boutique' sea salt I've come upon that seems well worth the extra cost. It's extremely tasty on heirloom tomatoes. It looks appetizing on steaks and chops, sprinkled at the last moment before serving. It's something to reserve for ""finishing"" and ""plating"" food. A six-ounce jar will last a long time in most kitchens, so this is a decent value.<br /><br />If you live in the South, you might try sprinkling alaea sea salt on the tail of the next ivory-billed woodpecker or Carolina parroquet you see, as a means of clearing the land for development."
positive,This is the first and only hawaiian salt Ive ever tried cooking with so I gave it 4 stars because I dont have anything to compare it with. It was absolutely delicious though. I used it on some pork shoulder with liquid smoke and put it in the slow cooker for 20 hours. It came out amazing. Cant wait to try this on different recipes
positive,"These crackers taste very good. The only problem is I ordered it in mid Oct 2011 and it says on the package that the best before date is 02JAN2012... This is a pack of 6, and each box weights 8 oz crackers. I don't think I will be able to finish 6 boxes in 2 months..."
positive,Better than the non-organic store bought brand.  They are crisp and taste fresh.  I will buy this brand again and again.
positive,"This is an excellent tasting product.  Hooray for Nabisco for putting out an organic saltine!  The cracker is very similar to regular Saltines, only perhaps even better tasting, and I am happy feeding this to my kids."
positive,Great tasting.  Kids love them and I don't have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients.  A little pricey if you don't care if they are organic.
negative,I regret to buy this here....The crackers are short-dated. I finally find somewhere online that sells it for less than $5/box. Don't buy it here.<br />But the cracker tasted good.
positive,Very interesting product to get delivered directly to the house.  Uber-GOURMET fun to have.  But be warned --  it is not ALCOHOL free.  This is a fermented product.
positive,"I'm a soldier in Afghanistan, and there is nothing more fun than watching the expression in an Afghan child's face when they try Pop Rocks for the first time... The adults love them too!"
negative,"Having ordered pop rocks for a group of students over a year ago, it seemed like a good idea to order the 36 pack for a new group this fall. The order was placed in early August. It is currently September and although I have written Amazon for resolution and they responded nicely, the order of pop rocks has yet to arrive. The rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders. Do be careful from whom you order."
positive,"Pop Rocks are the best candies I've tried. Don't get me wrong, I'm italian, spanish, and german and I love these candy. When negative reviews come, don't listen to them. Try using these candies on soda. Don't hesistate; Just Buy it! I'm also a heavy metal person. Gift these to heavy metal people."
positive,I tried this coffee in a Keurig and absolutely loved it.  I don't personally own a Keurig so I looked for it for my regular coffee maker.  I would definitely order it again.
negative,"I bought this hoping to use it for lemons and limes. Last night I needed to juice a lemon, so tried it out. It broke. Am going back to my tried-and-true glass juicer."
positive,I tried this on a whim at a organic food store- it was so unbelievably good!  It was a total surprise and I ate it straight from the package.  The only problem I see with this product is portion control!  It is that good!
positive,This coffee is on the mild side but a little too acidic for my tastes.  I will not order again.
positive,I am really enjoying these preserves.  My southern mother-in-law used to make her own pear preserves and they were to die for.  The Blue Ridge ones are the closest to hers I've been able to find anywhere on the market.  Thank you very much for making such an excellent product.
positive,"This is very good honey, full of probiotics, and the taste is fantastic... only wish it was<br />a bit more affordable and glass jars would be nice."
positive,"Great for making Cuban Bagels. Make a cream cheese sandwich with fresh Cuban bread. Smush down and place under broiler, melt a little butter on top and sprinkle with Bagel spice. Yum!"
positive,"Yep, this is A LOT of curry powder, but if you use it often in cooking, it really is a better price than paying several dollars for a tiny bottle (even McCormick's own tiny bottle) that'll be gone in no time - or worse, make you feel like you have to ration it.  I like curry powder and for once in my life, I wanted to use it and not feel I must skimp.  I paid just under $11 and in about a month, I've used maybe 3/4 of an ounce (I saved an empty 1 oz bottle to keep a more manageable portion on the spice rack).  Like another reviewer said, it IS possible it tastes a bit different from the 1 oz version, but I couldn't say for certain, and moreover, I don't think it's bad - I'm using it, mainly on rice dishes.  To me, it's legions better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B9JCFM"">Taste Specialty Foods Hot Curry Powder, 16-Ounce</a> but not as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTMZO"">Rajah Mild Madras Curry Powder 100g</a>.<br /><br />Google ""curry powder health benefits"" and you'll find plenty of results; it's best known for its benefits to digestion and for anti-inflammatory qualities, but also said to boost memory and protect against Alzheimer disease and cancer.<br /><br />Ingredients: Coriander, Fenugreek, Turmeric, Cumin, Black Pepper, Bay Leaves, Celery seed, Nutmeg, Cloves, Onion, Red Pepper, Ginger.<br /><br />The expiration, I'm pleased to note since there is so darn much of this(!), is April 2014."
negative,"I have tried at least a dozen different curry powders in the last several weeks and found that the McCormick 1 oz bottle is the very best by far.  Based on that, I purchased the 16-ounce bottle I saw on Amazon.  I was surprised when I found that the taste of the 16-ounce product was very different, to the point of not being able to use it."
negative,"It is seriously a bad taste.  No matter what we do, it tastes bad.  Bought the Orange and it is the most horrible taste.  Even when we put 1/2 a bottle in a gallon of orange juice, it takes bad, let alone when we put the whole bottle into the gallon mix of crystal light.  Do not waste your money."
positive,"I grabbed one of these at QT a few days ago, and have loved them ever since.  As I'm writing this, they're unavailable on amazon, but I'm diligently checking as I'll be ordering a lot when they start selling them.<br /><br />I use this as a light, high protein pre workout drink, and I love that it has caffeine as that really helps me push myself in my early morning workouts.  I've tried milk+whey, but it was too heavy for me and always seemed to sit on my stomach and make me feel sluggish as I was trying to lift.  I've also tried water+whey, but mannnn that tastes horrendous and I just have a hard time doing it.  And neither of those have caffeine, which I think really helps to energize me.  So far I've tried the grape and berry, and liked both.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />This does taste a little tiny bit bitter at times, and definitely isn't as good tasting as a protein shake, but it's perfect otherwise.  And you're not really drinking it for the taste anyways, are you?  Grab one of these, lift a lot of heavy weight up and down as many times as you can, follow up with a post-workout shake, rest and repeat, and you'll get strong.  Highly recommended!"
positive,"Pretty good stuff for the money.  Very fragrant, nice aroma.  Only complaint is includes artificial as well as natural bergamot flavoring.  Eh, my palate is not discerning enough to note the difference, but I have to wonder ... why not all natural?"
positive,"Love it! My favorite usage of this wonderful product is to add it to my morning porridge. For example, try semolina/yellow corn grits/cocoa butter chips or semolina/barley/cocoa butter chips. Of course you add the chips when the porridge is ready, you don't cook them. Enjoy!"
positive,"I love chai and raspberries, put together they are heavenly.  Big Train makes many drinks that I like, and this is no exception, in fact this may be my favorite.  There is convenience in the single serving, and the price through Amazon is much better than I could get locally."
negative,"These don't have an appropriate texture to be called ""cookies"". The ingredients aren't blended well, so it feels more like a granola bar to me, and I've always hated granola bars (even when I was unaware of their harmful effects on human health). They also smell artificially, which interferes with the perception of their taste... although I can't tell if they have any taste, besides some sweetness. Where did orange, ginger, and chocolate go?<br /><br />It's also irritating that the manufacturer doesn't talk about the ingredients in a simple and straightforward manner. Why say ""low glycemic monosaccharide"" and ""low glycemic fruit concentrate""? Admit that it is FRUCTOSE. It is not enough to say ""vegetable fiber"". They are supposed to know exactly WHAT KIND of fiber they use, because it makes a difference."
positive,"They have a sweet and ever so slightly tart, cherry vanilla flavor. I really like the flavor, I just wish it were a tiny bit stronger.  I leave them in a jar for my kids to enjoy, especially after snacks and meals.  Guilt-free and good for your teeth.  All in all, a great lollipop with pretty, swirly colors too."
negative,"Not very sweet. Very bland, and in my opinion too expensive for the product. Flavorless, doesn't taste like you're having a treat but the amount of carbs is high."
negative,The taste is like a bitter cherry. I don't like them but my kids do. Good be a little sweeter!
positive,Great for babies learning to taste and enjoy food.  I never thought he would love vegetables so much.  He loves these!
negative,The food is great and convenient to get it in an assorted pack but 18 pack means 9 PACKS OF 2. This is not a good deal and you can get these items for less as an individual purchase from almost any store.
positive,Great for the price.  Don't bake too long or you won't have the runny lava center.  Very quick & easy & comes with it's own little pans.
positive,"This cake was a very rich chocolate in the middle.<br />It was the family's first lava cake.<br /><br />So, if you love rich chocolate,<br />this is for you.<br /><br />I am going to bake the next one<br />longer to please the family.<br /><br />It is very quick & easy to do,<br />with a very good price!<br /><br />I bought this only for an occasional<br />treat as we are attempting to eliminate<br />processed foods.<br /><br />It just looked good, and it was!"
positive,"I lost faith in my long time cat food, Science Diet, after the massive pet food recall.  Fromm claims this dry food is made in the US (Wisconsin) from meat, cheese and vegetables bought from local growers.  Quality meats, no glutens, fresh vegetables and human quality vitamins.  The cats like it.  It is more expensive than Science Diet, but not prohibitively so.  Note:  the Milwaukee newspaper advises the canned Fromm is made in China.  I have absolutely no faith in the Chinese quality and safety control standards so I would not buy the canned foods."
negative,"Although this is listed as a 5-lb (225 kg) bag, it is NOT.  It is only a 2.5 lb (1.1kg) bag.  Believe me, I very carefully checked the shipping weight in the description when I ordered it because it was a good price.  That has been changed in the few days since I placed the original order, however the main listing heading has not been changed. VERY misleading."
negative,"I've submitted this review once before, and it appears to have been deleted.  Even odder, the description of the product has been changed to make it even more misleading.<br /><br />This is NOT a 5 LB bag, it is a 2.5 LB bag, which means you're paying twice as much per ounce as you should.  This is a comparable price for the 5 LB bag.  The seller needs to change both the description and the picture, otherwise they're going to keep cheating customers.<br /><br />All of that is a shame, really, because this is a very high quality food that my cats love. I recommend this kibble highly."
negative,"When did the rooster on the box get a cartoony face? Whatever happened to that wonderful abstraction? First they ruined Tony the Tiger, now this.<br /><br />And where did all the high fructose corn syrup come from? Admittedly, it is a flake of corn but that is a nasty ingredient to be skipped at all costs.<br /><br />It's things like that which drive people to the formerly odd grains like spelt and kamut!"
negative,"Admittedly, I had a fever.<br /><br />And I must say I am a devotee of the Corn Flake (though I only eat Trader Joe's Brand--Kellogg's flakes, though tasty, have too much crap in them).<br /><br />But Cereal City--the true target of this review--and a place that now has GREAT bearing on my thoughts about this product--was CREEPY.<br /><br />From the bald lady with two teeth who took our ticket and felt that this gave her liscense to engage us in a too-long conversation, to the Pennywise-looking clown that reeked of smoke--our first two minutes set the tone.<br /><br />Throw in a weird new-agey film with floating balls of light that became speaking versions of dead historic figures who never got along in life and pick up their arguments right where they left off on the screen.<br /><br />Add to that a poorly-lit animatronic Snap, Crackle, and Pop who end up either looking like they are rising from the grave or falling in worship at the feet of Tony the Tiger (depending on whether they are coming up or going back down).<br /><br />Our (hopefully) unique experience involved not being able to find a lady crucial to our scavanger hunt for 45 minutes (did she go in back and take a nap?) I want a shirt that says ""I waited 45 minutes to complete the Cereal City scavanger hunt and all I got was this crappy sippy cup.""<br /><br />Sadly there is much, much more...I could go on at length. But I won't.<br /><br />The main point is that I get the sense that Kellogg's, as a company, is just as creepy as its tourist trap. Avoid both."
negative,i was expecting this product to be like the picture and come in a small beer stein mug but it was plain jars of mustard. the mustard is fine but the picture is deceiving and i was buying the product for the glass beer stein as a present. not was i wanted.
positive,"The Fox's U-Bet Vanilla Syrup is great that I ordered.  The people I ordered from mixed the order up, and shipped the wrong quantity.  Even though I e-mailed them several times, they never got back to me at all.  So I still received the wrong order."
positive,"My husband absolutely loves vanilla egg creams but living in California, these are hard to come by!  With his birthday coming up, I wanted to surprise him with a genuine (vanilla) egg cream.  However, I had no idea how to make one!  So after doing a bunch of research  on all this, I found out it was essential to use UBet's Vanilla syrup.  Well, guess what, I did as recommended, followed the making of one down to the letter, and boy oh boy... not only was my husband thrilled, I now LOVE vanilla egg creams! This syrup is also great as a flavoring in sodas.  I highly recommend anyone to give it a try!"
positive,"This is a good basic vanilla syrup. I have used it as a sweetener for coffee, and added it to sparkling water to make a respectable cream soda. The price is excellent, after comparing it to Torani and DaVinci syrups."
positive,"I'm on a low budget, a lot of it consisting of canned foods like campbells chunky firehouse hot and spicy chili. Like the other reviews available mentioned, it is NOT spicy by any real standards. For anyone who's been to a curry house chain restaurant, and ordered ""hot"" and not extra/super hot, you'll realize the definition of hot is rapidly changing to fit the more moderate group of individuals. If I'm really trying to save money that week, I just have a can a day. Half a can with rice, for lunch, and half a can with rice for dinner. I prefer to have it with long grain rice since its generally a bit dryer and goes better with the liquidy nature of the chili. I eat it with cheetos flaming hot chips, not the healthiest diet by any means, but it is a VERY cheap meal, and tastes great with the combination of things. What I like most about the chili is its high fiber content, I'm not one for eating a lot of vegetables, so the fiber in this really helps."
negative,"This used to be one of my favorite canned foods, now the meat is rubbery.  It was not like this before they reduced the can size to 15 oz.  Barely edible."
positive,"My husband believes that this particular chili soup is better than his home made chili, which he will never make again as long as he can keep a supply of the Firehouse Hot & Spicy Chili on hand.  It is full of flavor,beef and beans and we have used it as a topping for baked potatoes. It is spicy, so if you don't like food that's spicy, don't buy this soup.  I have no idea how the other chili Campbell soups taste.  However, this is a winner."
positive,"This is a real hot and spicy chili. If you find it too hot, try the Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili."
positive,"Score another hit from Trader Joe's. These chocolate orange sticks are delicious.<br />We buy them and put them in gift baskets for friends or colleagues, or sometimes take them to the office to open up on my husband's desk to share.<br />Orange and chocolate is an interesting flavor blend, and most people find it to be delicious. The price here is more than you'll pay in your local store, though."
positive,"I have tried chai's from many different latte' stands.  It was hit and miss when it came to taste.  Luckily, my barista and my local stand told me it was the mix and not necessarily the barista.  She told me they used Big Train Chai.  She was right.  I can now make my own chai's at home using Big Train Chai that are as good as what I get from the latte' stands and have cut my morning chai addiction costs considerably."
negative,"so got the package, and through my own fault for not reading everything got hit with over $12 in shipping charges.  Really, don't know about you but to me, that is way too much.  So open the bag of tea... no scoop... directions read in hot water put 2 sccops in... no scoop... huh?  Was just informed they don't put a scoop in every bag... what???  So while I may enjoy the tea... forget it, last time I buy from this company.<br /><br />The old buyer beware is how I would rate this company."
positive,"My doctor recommended I use this formula as a supplement for my son. My son was not a premie but at 6lbs 2oz he wasn't breaking the scale either so the extra calories in this formula are perfect for him. Also for some reason he has no trouble going back and forth from breast milk to the Neosure formula, my daughter struggled quite a bit when I introduced formula in her diet, it wasn't the Neosure. Bottom line is I have been very happy, and so has my little boy."
positive,"LaCosta Gourmet's customer service is incredibly wonderful.  Tonight, I ordered only one pound of coffee that needed to be delivered in two days.  I tried to order it with upgraded shipping but, after I got Amazon's confirmation, it showed standard shipping and could take 8 days, given the intervening federal holiday and weekend.  Seeing that, I emailed La Costa Gourmet to see if the shipping could be upgraded to 2-day.  Within five minutes--I kid you not, 5 minutes!!!, Jeff at La Costa Gourmet called me, assuring that the order was due to go out first thing in the morning and is expected to arrive in two days, no need for an additional shipping fee.  I know that the order for one pound of coffee seems like a small matter but, it is for a family member heading overseas.  This small matter was very important to me and obviously very important to La Costa Gourmet.  They have earned my undying loyalty for customer service, great communication, & not ripping me off for an additional shipping fee."
positive,"This product is by far one of the best cookies this universe has ever known. Tiny TRON discs of delicate and balanced crunch and chocolate that ebbs and flows like a dream landscape, reality becomes liquid candles and you are the wick... set yourself ablaze and eat these cookies.<br /><br />They really are the best cookies, I'd place them side by side with those LU Cookies Le Petit Ecolier, The Little Schoolboy which can also be bought here on Amazon.<br /><br />Why settle for boring cookies when you can eat the best?"
positive,"These are sliced the long way, so they make nice strips to fold into eggs or drop into soup or whatever. They add a lot of flavor. Jalapenos aren't as hot as serranos. You can use both to get even more flavor. These are a good way to make your food a lot more interesting."
positive,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SWEET TASTY AND THE KIDS LOVE THEM....GREAT FOR PARTIES OR ANY HOT SUMMER DAY....ALL OF THE FLAVORS TASTE GREAT..."
positive,"I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!"
positive,"Worth every penny, a little goes a long way.  Ordered these and many snowcones later, still have plenty.  The taste is awesome, and the thicker syrup covers the ice great."
positive,"These candies are very good. They have a nice cherry flavor with just a little bit of sour thrown in. Most sour candies made these days make your eyes water and your mouth pucker. Not these gummi's, they have just enough of a sour taste to make them interesting but the sour taste is very very mild.<br /><br />My order came in great condition and very fresh."
positive,"My friends and I were quite disappointed when our bag of sour gummy cherries arrived. I love all the regular Haribo products but this is one I had never tried.<br /><br />Alas, the sour powder was more of a sugar topping. Not sour at all!<br /><br />Haribo makes good gummy candy, but saying these are sour is quite misleading!"
positive,"Finest Teutonic gummy candy. If you ever tried this you know what it is and you are getting your credit card right now.<br />6 out of 5 stars. Yes, they are that good."
negative,"i got this bag as part of the TWO bag ""special"", dont like how they rope you into buying two bags to get the Free shipping. making it $28 all together! these cherries are NOT at ALL Sour! Big Bummer! Even worse was that every single one of them in this 5 pound bag were BROKEN. none of them were in one piece, the stem connected to the cherry. i used them for Valentine favors, and they were NOT cute like the raspberries, because they were in parts. the non-saur part was the Big let down. they may have come broken because they were shipped in the Dead of winter. tho they did not sit outside for one second. so not sure if they always come broken. i will NOT be getting these again."
positive,So good I am sure this caused the 4 cavities my dentist found all over my teeth. I am a sugar fiend.
positive,These sour cherries are not too sweet and you cannot eat just one.  Great buy
negative,"These are way too sweet.  I'm a huge fan of Haribo Gold Bears, but this was a real let down.  Large chrystals of sugar overwhelm, with no trace of sour.<br /><br />yuck"
negative,"I was very dissapointed with these so called ""Sour Cherry Gummies"", as an avid haribo Gummy Fan, I was expecting at least some type of sour taste, instead just overly sweet and sugar coated, not even much Cherry flavor just very very sweet and overwhelming sugar flavor.<br />If u want some gummies that r sour and tangy, try Fizzy Cola bottles!!<br />They still have sugar coating but a very good, not 2 sweet tangy and tart flavor!! Enjoy...."
negative,"Haribo Sour Cherries were disappointing.<br /><br />I expected them to be ""Sour- Tasting"" &<br /><br />they were not. I would not buy them again."
positive,"Germans make the best candy.. well from what I can tell with these, YES!  My co-workers ate them all up in about 5 days.... That should tell you the quality.. or not because co-workers will eat anything!  No but seriously they are good.. not very sour.. like I said though. Totally awesome!"
positive,"I LOVE sour candy, so I thought I'd try these.<br /><br />The Haribo Sour Cherries are really good, and can last quite a while in your<br /><br />mouth if you can refrain from chewing them up!<br /><br />However, I find that you have to chew off either the leaf or the cherry<br /><br />to have an amount to eat that is the right size. Eating a whole<br /><br />sour cherry is too much at once!<br /><br />YUM!"
negative,"Take note: these are WHOLE WHEAT mixed with quinoa, NOT GLUTEN FREE quinoa. Wasn't made obvious that these were wheat on the sale page. I didn't even know Ancient Harvest made a wheat/quinoa blend. Argh! $25 down the toilet. Learn from my error!"
negative,"Well, the Amazon page might show you a nice box regarding celiac awareness month, and lots of gluten-free products, but, Alas, as I found and some have found, this is not a gluten-free product."
negative,Agree with all of the other reviewers! I buy the regular quinoa pasta all the time and want even aware that they sold a quinoa/wheat mix. Stuck with a product I cannot eat.
positive,"Every complaint says that this product is misrepresented.  However, the box clearly states Organic Whole Wheat - Quinoa Blend.<br />Also, the description on the page states: ""<br />Ingredients<br />Organic Whole Wheat Durum Flour, Organic Quinoa Flour.""<br /><br />I think the reviewers are misrepresenting their search skills and reading ability.  If all else fails, always check the website of Ancient Harvest, or at least find a health foods store and look at the box."
negative,"This product closely resembles the gluten free variety and does not do enough to demonstrate the difference. My wife has celiac disease, we bought this inadvertently and cannot return it."
negative,"I wanted to order gluten free spaghetti as I had before. This product, with nearly identical packaging, came up in the search results and I failed to notice it was wheat pasta. I discovered this only after opening the box.<br /><br />I donated the 11 unopened boxes to the local food pantry."
positive,"My brother from NYC introduced these to me last year.  I've purchased and eaten all flavors - they are amazingly crunchy and flavorful!<br />This is a small, family run company - there are just a few hands producing the graphics, cooking the nuts, and packaging them up for our consumption.<br />Their website has some gift options that come in beautifully crafted and unique packaging that are perfect for foodie friends and clients.  We sent them as corporate holiday gifts to some of our clients this year.<br />[...]"
positive,"I tried all of the flavors.  Every single one of them is delicious.  The cashews are of high quality, fresh & the flavors are so deliciously different than other cashews I had before.  Even the simple Lightly Salted is not the same as other lightly salted cashews in the market.  Highly recommended!  I even bought the ones with gift packaging for my friends & they all love it!"
positive,"I adore sardines and have tried them all... at Trader Joe's (the worst! so dry and flavorless!), at Whole Foods, at local gourmet shops, imported from all parts of the world. These are succulent with the perfect, rich flavor. Even my baby (less than 1 yr old) loves to eat these (I wish I could give her more but they have added salt). If you want the best, these are the best. Don't even bother with the other King Oscar sardines."
positive,"These sardines really stand out as the best national brand.  I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.  At any given time, I've got a dozen or so (one case) stashed away, and I rotate them along with my other necessities."
positive,These are still the best sardines in the market - can't find them locally in any stores - so get them by the case at Amazon.<br />These will make a sardine lover out of anyone!
negative,"These are advertised as tiny sardines (tiny tots) but they are almost exactly the same size as the King Oscar double layer sardines in the red label. I have taken a photo of one of each can, opened next to each other. You can hardly tell the difference. Why should I pay so much more for sardines that aren't any smaller or different tasting? Very disappointing."
negative,"I really didn't like these. They were mushy, not very flavorful and too oily. Tails left on a couple were kind of unpalatable. I found the Chicken of the Sea single layer smoked in soy oil to be firm and nice and smoky, albeit a tad salty. Better price too."
positive,"Couldn't find MSG anywhere.  It's more of a gag gift, but sweet baby it's MSG!!"
positive,Glad to say nice things about a healthy canned dog food my dogs actually enjoy (many of them are not to their taste.)  And Amazon makes it easy to obtain.  A great purchase.
negative,"I am not sure what has changed about this food, but my poor dog has been nothing but sick on this food, and she used to do well on it. I have noticed whenever I feed it to her, her stomach growls, she gets sick, and then she has uncontrollable diarrhea. I would not recommend it, get a better food. After I started looking around, it sounds like this food has caused a lot of illness and sometimes deaths in dogs."
negative,"Although my dog(schnauzer) is a picky eater, she likes the Blue Buffalo dry food (lamb/rice and chicken/rice).  I have tried both the turkey dinner and beef dinner, and neither is very appealing to the dog.  I have been forced to give away the remaining cans I bought (not inexpensive) to others to see if dogs would eat them.  Not at all impressed with Blue Buffalo canned foods."
positive,"My husband uses this on his popcorn, (along with chile powder, tomato powder, cayenne pepper, chili/garlic flavor flax seed oil and cumin). The effect is something like ""Chili Lime Tostios"". Pretty good stuff if I do say so myself. But we buy Twang only because we can no longer find his favorite at Whole Foods anymore [...]"
positive,My dogs (all four of them) love this food...even my 13-year old Pomeranian who gave up hard kibble a couple of years ago will munch at the bowl every now and again. Thank you for making a product that my dogs love and I feel good about feeding it to them :)
positive,"The product is great, but due to the price doubling, will not be purchasing anymore.  Very unfortunate situation.  My dogs did very well on this food."
positive,"These are as expected from previously eating them. Great price when on sale.  Shipped fast, long shelf life. Good to keep in case of zombie apocalypse."
positive,The candy was as described and just as I remembered it as a kid.  I normally get the atomic fireballs.  I have been eating those for years.  The only issue I had was the $8 for shipping them.  I figured that meant they would be shipped in a good box and secured.  I ended up getting them shipped in a bag with no packing or anything.  They were shoved in my mailbox and at least 10% of them were crushed or damaged somehow.  For $8 I really expected the shipping to be first rate.  Do yourself a favor and do not order anything from anyone unless it is shipped directly from amazon.
positive,I buy these bunnies every Easter for my husband and my father. They LOVE them. A bit expensive for chocolate but for once a year it's a nice splurge!
positive,"The chocolate was as good as we expected.  Preferring darker nutrition dense and flavorfull foods, this met our expectations.  We will purchase other products from this company as we have need."
negative,"Shame on me for not knowing what I was buying by not being sure how much the ounces were, but shame on the person for selling the bag of chips for that much money. I will never purchase anything from amazon again."
negative,"A couple of months agoe I was looking for Dynasty Mustard Powder and had no luck locally, so I searched Amazon and found it. I was thrilled and ordered (the minimum order of 12) online. I gave away several bottles to neighbor's never noticing the expiration date. Last week I used my first bottle for a dressing I like and it tasted very bland but didn' know why. I tried remaking it a day agoe and again, bland. I decided to check all the dates on the ingrediantes and found the exp. date on the mustard is July 15,2011. I noticed on my last old bottle I had, it was 3 years to expiration (but there is only a teaspoon left). I was so upset that they would send me an item (12 bottles) that would be out of date in two months!"
negative,"I'd like to make it clear that I really like pistachios. I eat a lot of this particular nut but these Setton Farms pistachios were beyond bad. There was a large percentage of nuts which were hard as rocks. The nuts which I could actually bite into tasted rotten. Also there were more empty shells than in any purchase I have ever made. I decided to check the expiration date and found that the date is not printed on the bag, but instead is on a stick on label. I carefully peeled back the label and discovered parts of other labels beneath. Imagine that?! No wonder these were totally inedible. I returned them for a refund. If anyone has any suggestions for good quality pistachios, please let me know."
positive,"This sauce is for those who love high heat and flavor to their favorite dishes, so it's not intended for the casual hot sauce lover who is not acquainted with the strong spice just yet. The heat on this product is very high, even a small amount that will leave your mouth and tongue burning several seconds after consumption.<br /><br />Personally, I like this sauce and the heat lingers for a while and goes great on sandwiches, in chili, salsa and other things you want to add an intense kick to.<br /><br />Recommended for the hot sauce enthusiasts."
positive,Have ordered from them before.... Nice company to work with and always friendly on the phone. They will even give discounts if you order more then one thing.
positive,My kitty is very fussy and has UTI issues. This is a really good product for UTI issues and he actually likes it.
negative,These giant gummy bears are horrendous! They taste like ****! They smell just as bad! Note in the picture that the blue raspberry bear is GREEN! I only made it a couple of bites into my blue raspberry one. My husband thought it was awful too.
positive,I bought a package of these tasty little snacks to keep in my desk for when those pesky afternoon hunger pangs hit. It was supposed to keep me from buying the sugary crap in the vending machines. Little did i know that they would quickly become an addiction for the entire office - from the CEO to the receptionist. I am re-ordering 2 packs this time - 1 for them and 1 just for me!
negative,"This product is NOT beef jerky or anything remotely like it. This product is neither spicy, nor beefy or meaty.<br /><br />What this product amounts to is a sour, salty, mushy, meat-based concoction pressed into stick form.<br /><br />And the ingredients*, to whom it may concern, are troubling to say the least.<br /><br />I'm currently inquiring in my social network about anyone with a dog who should like to have it. ('Who' may refer to the dog as well.)<br /><br />*Ingredients: Beef, Beef Hearts, Water, Soy Protein Concentrate, Salt, Dextrose, Spices, Corn Syrup, Smoke Flavoring, Paprika, Monosodium Glutamate, Flavoring, Sodium Erythorbate, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Sodium Nitrite. (Appetizing, ahem.)"
negative,"I have to say I am a beef jerky lover, I have tried many brands and makes of jerky and really have not found one I didn't like... until now. These beef sticks are not too spicy but have an odd taste to them, not sure what it is but one friend described is as a smokey twang. I have to agree, its an odd taste that is just not good, followed by a smokey cover up. I bought these to take to a boating party out at the lake because they looked like a good snack food, turned out I could not even give them away at the end of the day."
negative,"i got these in the mail the other day and they are horrible. it is like they took Pink slime and seasoned it and piped it into thin plastic.<br />i am very disappointed :-(.  these are a step above a dog treat.  i hate to leave a negative review, but 30+ dollars with shipping. I brought this bag into work and put them in my Drivers room......they are still there. usually ANY food left on there table is gone. \<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
negative,These are not very good. The taste is similar to slimjims but they're not as tasty. The texture is a little off too. A little mealy. If the taste was better or the texture was more appetizing they would have gotten a better review from me.
negative,"I finally received my order of  buffalo bills  hot shot Hot flavor 2.1 lbs. I bought this because of all the review. My first thought about the taste of this beef stick is that it tasted really sour and i tasted some spices but it was far from hot,it wasn't even hot at all. Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because  it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed. So i won't be buying the hot shots again and its not because i didn't receieve a sample. haha"
negative,"thick skin has more substance than the mush inside; called pepperoni but who knows why; so maybe try cut up in soup as last chance, or just for the animals"
positive,"I love jerky, and try most new brands I come across. Now and then I get a yen for beef sticks too, and here we are...<br /><br />Good points-- I agree that these are much less greasy than Slim Jims. The consistency of the filler is also much better.<br />  They came very quickly.<br /><br />Not so good points-- One review described them as 'spicy'. To me, 'spicy' adds twang while you're chewing. 'Hot' hangs around in your mouth after you've swallowed. These are 'hot'. They're not blisteringly hot; I'd go for maybe 4 or 5 on a 10 scale, but I wanted 'spicy' not 'hot'.<br />  They mostly just taste like some, uh... unique kind of liquid smoke. They almost taste like meat, but not quite.<br /><br />They're ok. I don't hate 'em, but doubt I'll repeat this particular experiment."
negative,"I wanted to try these out because of the price and because it seemed to have solid reviews. I really like Slim Jims, and this looked similar and had good reviews.<br /><br />I didn't notice any mushiness that some people claimed. I thought it had a good snap to it, although you can definitely see where the casing is and the rest of the product, and sometimes it will just slide out a bit.<br /><br />I like the packaging. You can stick these into a big slider ziplock bag and it makes it far more convenient than any individually wrapped product, like Slim Jims are. I don't know how well it will keep that way, but I think it should be fine because, well, these products are pretty much designed to be kept like that. I don't know why some companies individually wrap theirs, maybe someone else can chime in on that.<br /><br />And now for the negative. Originally I tried to be more diplomatic with it, because I didn't want to dock stars for it not tasting like a Slim Jim. My brother absolutely hated the sticks and considers them disgusting. I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.<br /><br />But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them."
positive,"Quality is sexexcellent, not excellent, but sexexcellent! Everything comes neatly packaged and they even give you free samples to try out. You can never go wrong. They are delish. As for these ""Short Shots"" they aren't really hot in my opinion, but they taste damn good and aren't 70% grease like Slim Jim (don't get me wrong, I love Slim Jim, but too greasy). You won't regret it, they are really, really good. This is my second time I've ordered and I've been more than satisfied with the quality."
negative,"What they don't tell you: The first three ingredients are:  Beef, Beef Hearts, Water.  They also include Monosoldium glutamate (MSG) and corn syrup.  I wish I had known what was in these."
negative,"I bought these on the strength of the reviews.  Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.  He said if anyone doesnt like what they get, they will replace it."
positive,"I bought these after having the craving being pregnant.  I searched for something that tasted like real meat but not greasy like slim jims and something I would feel good about eating and feeding to my 19 month old as well.  These are geat.  They're handy for on the go, very tasty and the paskage lasts a while.  Especialy considering I am pregnant and we pregnant women can go through some food!!!!"
positive,"Who would have guessed that Beef, Beef Hearts, and water would be so good together (evidently Buffalo Bill's)"
positive,I purchased these for my family to snack on and I haven't tasted flavor this good since I was a kid. It's worth every penny and you won't be unsatisfied. I found that we have purchased more of these and will be ordering more. This company has awesome products and stands behind their customers. Customer satisfaction is their number one priority.
positive,"I give the company high marks!  The product arrived quickly, and I very much appreciate the 'gift' package of free 'Honey' Jerky' included. The package was small, but delicious. That in itself prevents me from going below 3 stars.  I took off a star because the Hot Shorts are not even close to being 'mild', and far off from being 'hot'.  Another star because the taste is...just passable.<br /><br />I don't plan on ordering these specific 'Buffalo Bills Hot(?) Shorts' again, but I do plan on ordering other products of theirs.  I am a 'subscribe & save' customer here on Amazon and have a couple of other 'Jerky' subscriptions that I'll end up cancelling and then changing to other offers once I find better replacements."
positive,"Shipping was very fast, but the product is so so. Many other reviews compared these to Slim Jims in one way or another,so here is my thoughts. These are alot drier and a whole lot less greaser than Slim Jims, which is 2 good things about them, but I didn`t care for the flavor or after taste they leave you with. I rate these average at best, but will keep them for a quick snack now and then. Along with my order I also recieved 2 samples; Maple Pepper Beef Jerky & Buffalo Bills ""Moist & Tender"" Beef Jerky, both are very tasty and a product I will buy again. I still plan on trying more of CHOO CHOO SNACKS other products in the future."
positive,"These little sticks have great flavor and are the right price for what you get.  The package was used for the superbowl party I had and everyone loved them, should of ordered two bags!"
negative,"After tasting a handful of this product, I threw the rest out!  I love beef jerky but this product is not even close!!"
positive,"As a kid I loved to eat Slim Jims but gave them up as an adult because I can't tolerate the greasiness.  I wish I knew about Short Shots sooner because these things are a great replacement!  I originally bought the Mild flavor as a camping/hiking take along snack and it was well received by all of the adults, but none of the kids.  After our trip and running low, I bought the Pepperoni flavor which I found to be more peppery and much saltier than the Mild flavor.  While I prefer the Mild, my husband and older daughter prefer the Pepperoni.  Next flavor we will try is the hot.  The texture is drier and chewier than Slim Jims, but I think the quality is better also.  I realize some people have a problem with beef heart as ingredient, but muscle is muscle (and this is probably in Slim Jims too)."
negative,"Before purchasing this product, I read the reviews.  Most were very positive which ultimately convinced me to make the purchase.  Unfortunately, the only real way to know if you would like a product such as this is to taste it.  After doing so, I was very disappointed.  I found the flavor to be absent except for all of the salt.  It's labeled ""hot"", however, I didn't detect any spicy heat whatsoever.  The texture was stringy and chewy.  After chewing on them, the Short Shots wind up as a balled up mass which you either decide to swallow or spit out.  Overall, I did not like the product one bit and rated it with one star."
positive,"I read the reviews of these Short Shots & they get compared to Slim Jims a lot.  They are not anything like Slim Jims!  These are small, moist & most of all tasty little sticks of beef.  When you finish eating 1/2 a dozen (if you can stop there) of these, your fingers & mouth are not bathed in that orange grease that Slim Jims leave you with.  One bag of the Short Shots is almost 1/2 the cost of Slim Jims.  What gives there?  On the ""Bang For The Buck"" Scale, this product receives a 9+.  Only because a 10 is perfect & everybody knows that nothing is perfect nowadays.  Now I know I've said enough because I've just finished the 8th stick while typing this review!  Enjoy them, they're addicting!!!!"
positive,I buy this occasionally for work so the guys and me can have a snack for a few days. Tastes very simular to a Slim Jim but in my opinion a bit better. Best Jerky bang for your buck so you can't go wrong with it.
positive,"I wrote a negative review about Buffalo Bill's Hickory Beef Jerky, but I really enjoyed these mild beef sticks.  They have a lemony sourness that I found very appealing, and they were the perfect snack during long hikes.  I will order them again."
negative,"I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes."
positive,"These things are MUCH, MUCH better than Slim Jims.  These are exactly what I was looking for.  They are not all oily and greasy like other beef sticks.  I could probably eat the whole pack in a day! LOL!"
negative,"I ordered the mild sticks about 1 month ago an loved them. They were better than slim Jim's. Better flavor, less greasy. So I was running out and ordered more MILD sticks. I got the hot ones. These lack the snap of the mild so are less satisfying. The spice was nice, but still I want my mild sticks."
positive,Package arrived within 4 days of purchase. I LOVE the taste simply amazing.  My only complaint is I can't afford to buy 100 pounds of this stuff.
negative,"These are not really that good. They have like twenty or so ingredients but none add anything close to flavor. imo buy something else, also its 2 lb's so once bag is open have to store it in something else unless you eat it all at once and that would be unlikely with the before mentioned taste."
positive,"My daughter loves mild Slim Jim's so I decided to give these a try. As far as I'm concerned they taste very similar, but seem much less greasy to me.  THese end up being a better value than buying regular Slim Jim's and so I've got no complaints."
positive,"Only tried Hot.<br /><br />Amazon $25 on 02/12/2012.<br /><br />Pro<br />Value for weight & price<br />Tasty.<br />Nice Texture.<br />Outside Snappy.<br />All Beef.<br /><br />Cons<br />Hot is kind of mild, takes about 3 sticks before I feel it mildly.<br /><br />Would be nice if individually wrapped but Zip Lock Bags work just fine for portability."
positive,"They taste great, its the only way my and my shop can get fresh jerky out here in Afghanistan. Recieved the package promptly for my area and everything was fresh and un-damaged."
negative,The delivery was quick and the package arrived without issue. The reason for the 2 stars is because i wasnt satisfied with the Flavor . I just dont have a taste for it. so now i have 2 pounds of meat sticks that im not going to eat. the company did send a sample of its barbecue beef jerky which was really nice. next time i will have to order that. you win some and you lose some. it happens.
positive,I buy these for a snack for the guys at work and everyone loves them. They taste great and keep for a long time - not usually a problem when people grab them by the handful. I suggest buying these and the Hot; both packs last the 6 of us about 10 days. These are also a great side item for school lunches.
positive,"These are way better then Slim Jims. Less greasy and more flavor. The Mild Short Shot's are just a really good product, nice smokey flavor, no pockets of grease like a slim jim and very consistent. Fast shipping as always."
positive,"Purchased the mild shorts:<br />Gladly surprised when I opened the package up. They didn't feel or taste ""greasy"" in the least (think Slim Jims).<br />All in all, I think they were fantastic and the price point was pretty solid.<br />I will be purchasing again later."
positive,"When I saw the product on Amazon, I did'nt know the size of the package. 2.1# is a lot of meat. Ordered it on March 14th, got it on march 16th. Good beef sticks, and the sample pack of beef jerky was delishish!!!"
negative,"While the cost on this item is sure to bring attention, I found the taste to be a little bland while the product was dryer then I am used to with jerky of this type. Please note this is for the ""Hot"" version of this product (there are three flavors and I have not tried the other two so your millage may very on the other flavors) Shipment was fast and packaging was A1. Perhaps I'll give the other flavors a try."
positive,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my jerky-loving husband and was he ever happy. He thought they were great and we intend to order many more products from this company.<br />They are salty, and a bit greasy with a mix of chewy crunchy outer and a chewy inner. The first bite is a tad spicy but after that its fine. You defiantly can't stop at just one! My husband made me hide them from him because he quickly polished off about 8 of them and he wanted to make them last!<br />Also, our order was received three days ahead of the estimated time to ship them so that was a big plus.<br />My hubby was thrilled because the company also threw in a free sample pack of honey pepper jerky as a thanks ( the price of which covered the shipping and handling charge, so I feel like I got a good deal).<br />Completely pleased with this product!"
positive,"I enjoyed them as soon as I opened box!  I also purchased the HOT short beef shots They are incredible and leave a wonderful HOT warmth to your mouth.  These are so much better than Oberto and I went to school with those guys, they were friends of our family. They have good, but this is better than that in my mind! Excellent sticks not bland and icky, they are GREAT!"
positive,"De verdad los productos de esta marca son excelentes, pero a pesar de ser de carne tienen una textura un poco grasosa y un sabor acido, prefiero las Slim Jim.<br /><br />this brand is excellent, but the taste is sour and the texture is a little greasy, i prefer the slim jim."
positive,"I've been ordering these for the past year or so. They make amazing snacks for camping trips and they're fun to share with people (until they come back asking for 2nds... and 3rds...). Yeah, they're that good. As some others have said, imagine a Slim Jim, but without all of the grease that soaks out everywhere. It's true that it doesn't have that 'authentic' pepperoni taste, but in my opinion it's more than good enough. Not only that, but the people at Choo Choo snacks are generous enough to add in a sampler for some of their other products in every order. Their jerky samples taste incredible, but I'm more of a beef stick person. I like the snap that they make when you bite into them. Buffalo Bills short shots are more than worth the asking price. If you've never tried them before, don't be afraid. If you're a fan of meat snacks, you'll like these without a doubt. Hell, I bet you could even get some vegetarians to convert just from the scent. :D"
positive,"I was real excited to get these and I was personally disappointed with the heavy beef heart texture and gently flaking casing. My friends though swear they're better than slim jims as they are much less greasy. They didn't taste bad to me, they were just not my thing. ChooChoo was awesome as usual with fast shipping. Try em, they're cheap enough and everyone else loves em."
negative,"The taste was somewhat greasy.  Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better."
positive,"These are good little beef sticks.  I bought the mild, but I wonder if I'd enjoy a more spicy one.  The flavor isn't the best for this sort of thing, but it's far from the worst and is quite good.  Just not quite up to a ""five star"" rating for me.  Still, I can't complain and I'd order products from these people again, just try a different flavor or product maybe next time.<br /><br />As an aside, they also sent a sampler size pack of their ""country cut"" beef jerky in Teriyaki flavor, and that I found to be excellent.  The next thing I buy from them might be the beef jerky instead, just based on the small sample package I found that much closer to a five star product.<br /><br />I did a seperate review for the seller proper, but in brief I'd call their shipping five star, very fast and well packaged.  Just for the record without making a comment pro or con about whom they used to ship, they used US Mail."
positive,These mild beef sticks are awaesome....they taste great and much better than Slim Jim's.  I'm a beef stick fanatic and this is one of the better beef sticks that I have tasted.  Not oily or greasy at all.
positive,"I like the slender, easy to pack, snack, toss around<br />feel of these little fellas.<br /><br />Bought em twice now, and will likely buy them again."
positive,"I've been trying unsuccessfully to find this flavor.  I've bought out all the A&W cream sode jellies in the Target and Cub Foods stores in my surrounding metropolitan areas.  They never replenished this flavor.  So, I just thought I'd try googling them - was I excited to find amazon carries them - I'll be ordering shortly!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"This is some of the best tea! Great flavor and great benefits too! A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts forever."
positive,"If you have a chance to visit the Tao of Tea shop at 3430 SE Belmont Street in Portland, Oregon, you'll find a unique place with a unique approach to tea. Fine tea there is not chopped beyond recognition. Think of a salad bar of various teas, all nicely dried, of course, displaying a range of colors and shapes that cry out to be sampled. Tea is, of course, a matter of taste. I especially like the Kukicha, which includes tea leaf stems that provide a richer, darker taste that I crave. Getting it from amazon.com is much easier for me, since I live in Southern California, and cheaper than at the local store that carries it."
positive,"These taste awesome and until you taste it yourself you won't know what your missing.  They are my crack, I can't stop at just one.  They lie somewhere between a candy bar and a biscuit.  I am so glad I found a place to purchase these in the U.S. :}  The closest thing I could compare them to stateside would be if you replaced the peanut butter in a Little Debbie's Nutty Bar with caramel.  So much better though!"
positive,This brews a wonderful pot of tea that's great hot and also delicious cold. The ginger adds just a hint of zing to a slightly sweet black tea. I've been drinking a lot of it!
positive,"This is my most favorite tea.  My most excellent Sis got it for me several years ago, and now, since I asked for it, I got it again.  It is very pretty.  It smells wonderful, just like it tastes (fruity and spicy)  I have not checked it yet, but suspect that it is very good for you also.  After I have checked that out, I will update this.<br /><br />I guess it is very good for you.  If you are a health nut, add buckwheat honey (antioxidants) and lemon (helps get more of the good stuff into your system)"
negative,Used to be made in america now there soggy not chewy and made in mexico!No wonder the price has dropped at the local store $2.59 for this box.
positive,"One of the troops I support, who is currently in Iraq, is from Louisiana, and he was craving Louisiana Original Hot Sauce.  He made a bet with another friend that we couldn't get it to him...I proved him wrong...and he was delighted.  Louisiana Hot Sauce gave this soldier a taste of home, and he definately gave it 5-stars for giving the pretty bland food served in Iraq a ""taste of home""."
negative,"I was very disappointed in the ropes. They were tough to eat. If I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds, they were pretty good. I did get a response from the seller, and they said that they were in a warehouse, and due to the cold weather, they were firmer. The ropes were within their expiration --or shelf life date. I probably will not order them again."
negative,The licorice was stale and many of the wrappers were split.<br /><br />I would not buy from them again.
positive,"Big Red - the unofficial soda of Texas is excellent.  It's hard to pinpoint the exact taste; some say bubble gum, while others compare it to cherry.  Regardless, you should definitely give this a try.  Best tasted cold - you won't regret.  I only wish it was distributed in New England."
positive,this is a TX fav.  but not living there anymore.  decided that i needed a taste of home and found it right here.  drink up!!!!
positive,I love this soda.  I wish I could find a store where I live that sells it.
negative,Well I had to try it based on the rave reviews. Glad I only purchased 12 cans ... I just don't like this stuff at all(can't give them away fast enough)... Tastes like carbonated perfume to me. If you want a REALLY DELICIOUS creme soda try Hansens Cherry Vanilla Creme. Now THAT is a GREAT creme soda
positive,"I love red cream soda... not the plain cream soda.  Red Cream soda can be hard to find so I went looking online and found this - and tried it a few times.  I love it!!  Its worth the extra cost in shipping.  I tried the diet big red too and loved it (and I'm not a diet drink fan).  Also, some red cream sodas are too ""syrupy"" or too sweet...this Big Red is just right."
positive,"Back when I was a child my parents used to buy this for us while we were camping.  For years I didn't see a drop of it, but it was always there at the back of my mind.  Recently I've found that they've started stocking it in a near-by gas station.  Its a bit more expensive there, but definitely worth it.<br /><br />The GREATEST soda I've ever come across."
negative,"I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown. I followed the instruction and even did some research work through the internet. I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter. I tried to contact the merchant and ask for advise, but I did not get any response. I have other bonsais and regular gardenias that are healthy and I really wanted this gardenia bonsai so bad."
negative,I'm always hesitant to write a negative review because tastes are different but with this product I felt I had a duty to alert consumers.  I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf.  I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die.  I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs.  The plant died two weeks later.  I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.
negative,"I ordered this plant and I can't even beleive you're allowed to lie like this and get away with it. The item description clearly states that the plant is supposed to be a 4yr old that is 8 inches high and in a 10 inch pot. This is not my plant at all, its about 6 inches if that and in a 6.5 inch pot. I can't beleive I paid $32 for this plant. There is no one to get in contact with to return it or ask WHAT IS GOING ON?!?! I don't understand why you say you will give a plant that is completely different from what I received. I am very unsatisfied with my plant and even more with your bad service, no one anwsers my emails or questions. If anyone can help me, my email is chanteldionne@hotmail.com"
negative,"Not sure if the plant is going to survive, The pot was broken when we opened the box yet the shipping box showed no signs of damage. I can't find out how to return it either since it is a plant - these independent Amazon merchants make returns difficult : (  So much for this present."
positive,"The bonsai was packed well and looked great out of the box.  It shed a lot of leaves about a week after arriving, giving us a scare, but new leaves are now sprouting out all over the place.  It's healthy and growing."
negative,"Positive: Gardenia Bonsai arrived in good shape and packaged well.<br /><br />Negative: Did not look like a Bonsai at all, they advertise they are suppose to be 4 yrs old?? Mine looked like a normal Gardenia bush that was pruned way back and stuck in a small pot. I plan on returning it, my wife was disappointed because it was a christmas gift for her!"
negative,"I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as ""highest"" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan"
positive,"I reviewed some of the comments from others about broken branches, and dead leaves.  I was very worried what I would get but my tree arrived in one piece no broken branches and beautiful.  I love the bonsai I have only had it about 2 weeks and already I have a ton of buds on it which should be blooming in the next week.  This was a great buy for the price!!"
positive,"I was a bit worried from some of the reviews I read here on Amazon, but this Bonsai arrived as pictured(minus the flowers, not in blooming season)  I even used Amazon's free supersaver shipping.  We have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good.  Very good value from Brussel's."
negative,"The bonsai plant itself looked like it could have been beautiful.  Unfortunately, when it was shipped to South Dakota around Christmastime, the state was experiencing extremely cold temperatures.  Only packing peanuts were used for insulation, and the plant died.  Restrictions should be placed on shipping these type of products to cold climates or packing material that provides better insulation should be used."
negative,"Not too thrilled with this one though.  Seems to not have any growth and getting yellower by the day.  I'm not sure it survived shipping very well.  It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week.  I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter.  The only thing it seems to attract is bugs.  We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad.  I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has."
negative,"So it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers.  Was really optimistic, no instructions - i.e. how old is it? After the flowers died, it got fleas, which are soil related. It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs."
positive,"I will admit, I was very hesitant buying this after reading the 3 negative reviews on the main item page description, but I ordered it anyways, I always wanted a flowering bonsai as I only have had the pleasure of having regular bonsais. But when I received, it was extremely healthy and taken care of. Only 3 leaves needed to be trimmed due to discoloration from being inside the box. I know it will take time to flwoer and won't expect it right away. My only concern is that the potting soil is not what I expected. I expected it to be softer and easier like the soil is supposed to be with bonsais, but instead it was regular soil with wood and rock in it. When I got to transplant it later on, I will be fixing that for sure because I want it to grow up healthy.<br />But it's growing quite well and nothing was broken or dead. It was shipped out the next day and arrived at my house 3 days later. The other negative reviews probably had their shipping take longer and that is why the leaves were dissatisfying.<br />Awesome work on this little guy, I would buy from you again. :)"
positive,"The tree came with no problems. It was packed well, no issues with the packaging or anything, it was all perfectly intact. It is very healthy, with a ton of buds and has no problems whatsoever. Fancy fancy little tree."
positive,I received this as a gift and think it is a wonderful plant. Much better than cut flowers that will die off in a week. My bonsai arrived in really good condition with no broken branches and green leaves. It doesnt have any flowers or buds but I am hoping with a little love and care it may eventually get some Gardenias.
negative,"PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE. LOOKED GREAT ON ARRIVAL AND WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE. THREE WEEKS LATER ALL GONE, UNLESS YOU LIKE MINATURE BROWN TREES!  IF I TOOK CARE OF IT I'D EXPECT THAT OUTCOME. BUT MY WIFE HAS A GREEN THUMB AND REALLY TRIED TO SAVE IT."
negative,This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves.
positive,"I am really please with this bonsai. I can already see that it is going to bloom soon, i am so looking forward to the sight and the smell.<br />My only problem with this item is that i received it WITHOUT the plate that i shown on the pic. Amazon resent me the whole thing again (They can't send only part of the item) but still the plate didn't come with it.<br />I don't understand why i didn't get the item the way it was shown on the website....that's a pity i am quite disappointed."
positive,"Shipment was delivered fast. Dogs love lamb ears, good for their teeth and healthy for them. Will purchase again."
positive,"I found buying online by the 50-count box -- with free shipping -- considerably cheaper than buying individually at my local pet supply store. These are a nice size for my two small dogs, and<br />are very clean with no odor.  Many body part treats seem to be messy and smelly, but not these.  I recommend them for small dogs, a big dog would probably demolish one in 2 seconds.  Keeps my guys<br />busy for about 20 minutes."
negative,"Product received quickly but unfortunate it gave my dog diarrhea after one lambs ear.  After waiting several days I tried again with same results.  Returned the lambs ears, placed an order for more lambs ears with a name brand that she had eaten before.  I went through the same company so they still got a sale.  Wish I had of waited before ordering.  I received a credit minus 6 missing lambs ears.  Since I had only taken two from the box, I figured I must have been shorted to begin with.  Meanwhile I paid shipping two ways and had a vet bill for $225.00 because the dog had to be put on antibiotics to clear up the diarrhea."
negative,"Product was shipped lose in a large box, 3 times to large, resulting in the container breaking.  Most of the product was crushed, melted, and unusable. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."
positive,Bought two of these for a green and blue candy buffet and these are perfect. They look great and are super tasty!
positive,"Even though I did not get to eat any, my children told me they went through it like nothing and exclaimed they were DELICIOUS! I wasn't expecting anything less knowing that Andes mints are scrumptious ^_^"
positive,very good service recieved it alot earlier than expected I ordered right before christmas kinda late but recieved it in enough time for christmas  thank you great service
negative,"The tablets had discolored from age.  These tablets are suppose to be yellow, not orange or rust colored.  I should have returned."
negative,"ANYTHING is better than these.  Some taste bland.  Some taste like wax.  Most just taste really weird, kind of bitter, and just not Good.<br /><br />Here are some chocolates that taste a Lot better than these...<br /><br />Sees<br />Ghirardelli<br />Lindt<br />Reeses<br />Godiva<br /><br />Just to name a few...<br /><br />Even Palmer Chocolates found at Dollar Stores taste better than these!!"
positive,"Just got this as a gift, and we were really impressed with the box/wrapping. The chocolate is good, but I think I've had better from Sees in general. This box has about 12 flavors per box. I think the hazelnut (?), chocolate (square one), and french vanilla (?) are really good- most have a light texture to the filling that is really nice. It would be nice if it came with a list of what the flavors are...<br />Oops- just noticed that this is $40 for 2 boxes. I think it's good enough to be $20. :)"
negative,Just got this as a gift and it tastes like it's sold by junior highers to make money (like wrapping paper). it's not chocolate as much as it's cheap waxy choco-flavored covering a ball of sugar and lard. Do not buy this. Disgusting product. Don't be tricked.
positive,"I've always been a fan of Figs, and these are the best I've tasted.  I don't like the dates and apricots as much but even if I could buy the Figs by itself, I'd probably still go for this mixed pack since it becomes a snack with a bit more variety and texture.  The figs are very soft with an odd crispness to the outside, while the other items are much more chewy.  Watch out for the small seeds though!"
negative,I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.
positive,"The Mi-Del Royal Vanilla Cookies do not have a ""cream center"".  The center is a vanilla-flavored hard sugar disc.  The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc.  After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first.  I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard.  Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase."
positive,"I order two (2) cases of cookies on the same Amazon order. A case of Ginger Snaps and case of Chocolate Cookies from another manufacture.  Both cases arrived quickly from Amazon.  But the ginger snaps had many bags where nearly the entire bag of cookies were broken up and in pieces.  The other case of cookies (Chocolate Chip) was perfect, Hardly any of them broken."
positive,"I like all the gluten free flavors of cookies that Mi-Del makes.  These are a perfect ginger snap.  Yes, they are crunchy and spicy, but that is what I expect in a ginger snap.  They are wonderful to dip in milk.  The milk cools the spiciness and softens the cookie.  My kids like them so much I have to hide them if I want some left for later!"
negative,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
negative,"These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left."
negative,"Hard as a rock.  Some companies are able to make gluten free sweets palatable, but these are really not very good.  Soaked a cookie in milk for 5 minutes and it did not soften."
positive,yummy! these are amazing. thanks midel for making delicious gluten free cookies. these melt in your mouth. most gluten free foods taste like cardboard but these are very tastey. i'm hooked....
negative,"We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems."
negative,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
positive,"Good tasting cookie.  Will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Very hard, though.  Definitely good for dunking in your coffee!"
negative,THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.<br /><br />SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.<br /><br />FOR ME I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.........
negative,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
positive,"I WAS SCEPTICAL AT FIRST ABOUT A SANDWICH, GLUTEN FREE COOKIE.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  THEY TASTE GREAT!  HOWEVER, I HAD TO STOP EATING THEM, I AM ALLERGIC TO POTATO!  WHAT A BUMMER.  I WANTED A SANDWICH COOKIE AND THIS FIT THE BILL.  I BOUGHT A CASE, TOOK SOME COOKIES TO WORK AND EVERYONE IN THE OFFICE LOVED THEM.  (I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN THE OFFICE)  SO WHEN I COULD NO LONGER EAT THE COOKIES, THE OFFICE ATE ALL MY COOKIES!  THEY WANTED MORE.  I DIRECTED THEM TO AMAZON.COM.  THE LADIES IN THE OFFICE HAD NO IDEA, GLUTEN FREE COOKIES TASTED SO GOOD.  THEY HAVE ALSO EATEN MY CHOCOLATE CHIP, GINGERSNAPS, SHORTBREAD COOKIES TOO.  SO THESE COOKIES APPEAL TO EVERYONE!"
positive,"Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste ""good"" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including ""regular"" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!"
positive,"We love these cookies, better than ""K"" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the ""K"" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the ""K"" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price."
positive,"These are so tasty! Just the perfect amount of sweetness! They are nicely brown around the edges, so delicious!"
positive,I will buy these cookies again. I am glad that I order them regardless of the not so good reviews.
positive,"Delicious? Check!<br />Gluten free? Check!<br />Good price? Check!<br /><br />Thank you, amazon, for making these great cookies available!  It is difficult finding things to eat when you have a gluten intolerance and it is even HARDER finding things to eat that TASTE GOOD!<br /><br />All of the celiacs in my family enjoy these animal crackers! Five stars!"
positive,"Mi-Del Ginger Snaps are far better in texture and flavor than any I have ever purchased. I have eaten many varieties of ginger snaps in my 85 years of life, and appreciate this as an exceptionally good product.  The only problem I have is that I can't stop eating them!"
positive,"These cookies are a wonderful replacement for any kid ( or grown up ) wanting to eat a long time favorite. There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk. These pack well in bags for lunch  ( don't break up easily ) so they would do great in a kid's lunch for school or daycare. I actually give these cookies to people to show them gluten free doesn't mean cardboard."
positive,"Ginger Snaps are delicious.  Not too sweet and loaded with flavor. Wonderful texture, great with a nice cup of tea."
positive,I picked the Cinnamon Snaps up at my Grandma's local health food store the last time I visited and loved them.  I have yet to try the ginger snaps but I'm sure they are just as good.  Hopefully Amazon will start carrying the Cinnamon Snaps.
positive,Hard to find products that my son's diet allows him to eat.  This is a great treat.  He loves them.  I have a hard time keeping out of the opened bag of cookies myself.  They are crunchy but we love them.
negative,This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.
positive,"Thanks to hubby's recent diagnosis of gluten allergy, I've begun to explore the world of gluten free foods. While some are quite bland, these little cookies pack a flavorful punch! Nothing ""depriving"" here."
positive,These Ginger Snaps were very good but I ordered the gluten free ginger snaps and they were shipped in error and all my complaints to Amazon were ignored.<br />Bill
negative,"I ordered these for my son (age 11). He doesn't like them at all. I thought they would be similar to the Kinnikinnick cookies we get at our local health food store, but they're not. These are rock hard and although sugary, otherwise have no flavor. We'll stick with the Kinnikinnicks. I'm just hoping maybe I can use these for making a cookie crumb crust."
positive,"I love these and it is the best treat.  I love cookies and couldn't find one that was very good until I found these.  I can eat a whole bag in one day!  Matter of fact, I need to order another case."
positive,"Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."
positive,"Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family."
negative,"Sadly, the cookies in this shipment  were soft (they should be crunchy).  I now only buy them from the store self where they are fresh."
negative,"If you are looking for mild ginger flavored snaps...these are not it.  If you however, enjoy a very strong ginger taste, give these a try."
negative,"These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste.  I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it."
negative,"Took FOREVER to arrive and the case is way too many cookies to consume! Will stick to my local organic grocery next time. Once again, ordering food from Amazon has fallen far below expectations."
negative,Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages. That's a total of six (6) small chews for $30.00 not including shipping! I couldn't return my order quick enough.
negative,"I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the ""bone"".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well."
positive,"My hound is surprisingly picky about treats.  But these are his all time favorites.  He, Wimsey, likes all the chicken top/treated Beefeater products"
negative,THIS IS NOT A PACK OF 12 BUT OF 3. I AM VERY UNHAPPY. PRODUCT IS NOT AS DESCRIBED  DO NOT ORDER IF YOU EXPECT 12 BONES. RIP OFF.  AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
positive,"I was very pleased to discover a few years ago that HometownFavorites continues to sell Moxie, which according to Wikipedia has ""a unique flavor that is not as sweet as that of most modern soft drinks and that is described by some as bitter"".  Most sodas are too yucky sweet for my taste, but Moxie has a zingy flavor that I really like.<br /><br />Even so, I don't drink any non-diet soda (non-nutritional junk, imho), so I'm glad that a diet version is available.  I've bought it both directly from HometownFavorites and via Amazon.<br /><br />Some of its appeal to me is undoubtedly nostalgia for a regional brand from New England, where I grew up. (I don't recall actually drinking the stuff as a kid.  It was out of fashion by that time, and like most kids, I probably wouldn't have liked the slightly bitter taste.)  If you're looking for a soda for grownups, you might like Moxie."
positive,"I ordered this for a friend for Mothers Day and she cannot stop raving about it!<br />The shoe is well crafted and the packaging well done.  It's a delightful gift, something definitely different and I just ordered another one for a Birthday present!<br />  Jayme Wills"
negative,"The description says 12/5 oz bottles, but you only get one bottle. What a rip off! The sauce is delicious, but you'd be better off buying from the manufacturer ([&#8230;]). Or if you are in Boulder, stop by Vitamin Cottage ([&#8230;])."
negative,"This is great hot sauce, but this is false advertising. Only one bottle will be sent, and they'll charge  $10 for shipping it--$20 per 5 oz of hot sauce. Totally absurd. Notice that they still haven't changed the description!"
positive,"I remember whipping up a batch of these bad boys when I was about 14 years old (I'm 22 now) I went to town on the whole batch! After a while I noticed almost everyone stopped selling these even Wallmart who usually tries to provide products for as long as they can. I almost thought they were discontinued and I was heartbroken when everyone stopped selling them at local stores, but Amazon is like my retail hero! They keep all of the best stuff in stock and they stay in contact with people who distribute. I even found U.S. military issue meals ready to eat here on Amazon.com. I don't trust eBay with anything! Thanks for keeping these available Amazon.com! I Will be ordering them when i have the money! They seem a bit pricy tome here."
positive,WOW!!!!  these are Easy and fantastic!!!!  I will be buying these again.  If you need a quick desert this is it!  3 step process and then put them in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up.  The end result is fantastic.  they were much better than I expected.  Everything in the process worked just as easy as it looked from the instructions.  Usually I make this kind of thing from scratch but not anymore.
positive,"I've been using Turmeric powder for years after I read how beneficial it is for many health problems.  Prevention  is my way, whenever possible, to combat the possibilities.  At least I can try and be in control of my own health care.  It's tasteless and add a nice color to eggs."
positive,"A family member brought this product to St. Martin where we were vacationing.  The six of us ate it with a variety of crackers and it was delicious!  We finished the whole thing in one sitting.  The foi gras is thick but fairly easy to spread as long as you have a sturdy cracker, and it has a delicate flavor that I love.  There is a nice layer of fat at the top."
negative,"So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods?  What gives?  Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is?  And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line.  So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal).  People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
positive,"The item was received in only a few days of placing the order, and it was in excellent condition.  As it was milk for cats, I personally have no knowledge as to the quality, taste, etc (I love the cat but there are limits!) but the only important qualification was that my cat enjoyed it, and he surely did, so it's a winner all around.  Thank you very much."
positive,"My husband has been a Diabetic for years........and until Diabeti Sweet came out.......it was a real problem to try and bake any items for him, that would taste, bake and LOOK like the item was supposed to.<br /><br />Diabeti Sweet looks like real sugar....feels light real sugar....and weighs like real sugar....thus when you make a cake, or cookies or any other item......it comes out looking just like the original recipe made with real sugar.  When you use ""those other"" sugar substitutes, they don't have any weight, as a result, your cake is flat both is looks and taste....your cookies never set up, because there is no volume to them.<br /><br />Diabeti Sweet IS the best thing since sliced pickles!"
positive,"the raisins were dry but, flavorful. I figure it is because they don't have all the oils and preservatives that other raisins have. they are black and vary in size, some looking like they are grapes that went bad, which I just toss. Don't think that I would buy them again."
positive,We love these!  This was a great deal as these are sold for much more at our supermarket as I bought this at about ten bucks here.  Chewy and very spicy so beware..if you love cinnamon you'll like these. Mine don't expire until 2013.
negative,"I got these cause of the reviews,these are not cinnamon enough for me,just okay. But great for gifts for halloween."
positive,I love the cinnamon mentos and they are hard to find in my area. I would probably not purchase them again unless the price goes down.
positive,Could beat this deal - I will buy it again if it shows up under the deal of the  day.  Enjoyed my everyone.  Watch for this to go on sale again.
positive,This is the second time I've sent this assortment as a gift and both recipients (one age 20 and one age 50) raved about the beautiful arrangement and the delicious taste of each and every piece of fruit.  Both times the present was shipped promptly and arrived exactly on time as promised and in excellent condition.
positive,I ordered this dried fruit selection as a Chanukah gift for my mother. She loved it. Her gift was well packed and arrived (after a serveral day delay due to mishandling by USPS) in perfect condition. The fruit quality was excellent. She and her friends have really enjoyed it.
positive,"I bought this during the lightning deals specials and thought it would make a nice snack tray for everyone to pick at instead of eating junk. I was rather disappointed when I read the ingredients and found that the fruit not only has fake color (I'm allergic to Red 40) but is also injected with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Why do manufacturers constantly seem to seek out new ways to ruin something that should be good? Overall, the pineapples (and cherries, according to my kids) are too sweet and taste a little wrong, but I'm pretty happy with the figs and apricots."
negative,Hate to give a gift that turns bad...and this was horrible.  The absolute worst fruit.  I tried this and the only thing that was decent were the apricots and pineapple rings.
positive,Better fruit then you can get at the grocery store.  The dates rolled in coconut are very good.  All of the fruit is soft and sweet.  I would recommend this as a gift and I will probably buy it again.
negative,The actual package received is not at all as shown in the product picture.  This seriously reduces the value.<br /><br />Beware the other Black Friday or Cyber Monday savings from this company.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for kicking off the holiday season with this bait and switch.<br /><br />I'm happy with Amazon 95% of the time.  They missed on this one.<br /><br />Postscript:  Amazon refunded a large enough portion of the purchase price to satisfy me.  Kudos for their honorable response.
positive,"My mother loves dried fruit, and was thrilled with this fruit tray. It was as beautiful as in the pictures, and the quality of the fruit was unrivaled. I will be buying from Broadway Basketeers again."
positive,"This basket of dried fruit was very good. It arrived before the date promised, and was in excellent condition. I have had dried fruit from other merchandisers,but this was the best I have ordered in quite a while. I order quite a bit of merchandise from Amazon and am well pleased with their suppliers. I recommend Amazon to all my friends."
positive,"very pleased with this item.  Had almost everything I was looking for, packaged nicely, and the product was delicious!  Definitely would do it again!"
negative,I thought these were going to be dried fruit. Turns out it is dried but full of sugar. Not what I needed. Taste is ok though.
positive,"This was purchased for the ""fruit wedding anniversary"" (4th year)  gift. It was perfect since the couple had everything they needed and something edible would not clutter their home. The fruit basket for the most part looked like the image, but the plastic wrapping was poorly done which cheapened the overall aesthetic. The fruit was mostly tasty. There was some that I didn't like, but it could be a matter of personal taste. Everyone else who tried it loved it."
positive,"This product is by far the best brand flavored tea I have ever tasted.  I find that other brand flavored teas have such a wonderful aroma, however, the tea tends to be bitter--tasting nothing like the intended fruited flavor.  The Ahmad strawberry tea has a rich and smooth strawberry flavor, no matter how long I allow the tea bags to steep.  My family loves it as iced tea--as do I. We enjoy it so much, I make full, three-quart pitchers at a time and its always gone by the end of the day.  This year, I have already purchased four large boxes--20ct/6 bx--120 tea bags per box and now am purchasing the last of the 10 ct/12 bx box. I've gotten some great deals on here (as low as $.12 cent/tea bag)--on the internet, this tea runs $.18-.20/tea bag which adds up when you are buying 120-240 ct boxes."
negative,"Have ordered the strawberry tea bags for over a year, this order I received strawberry sensation tea bags. Don't like the strawberry sensation, wanted just strawberry."
positive,I never thought I'd like fruit flavored tea until I had the Ahmad brand products. This one is my favorite with the peach passion fruit and mango being my other favorites. The flavor is that of a black tea with an aroma of strawberry that isn't overpowering or artificial tasting. This is a superb tea to drink before bed. The price on Amazon is almost half that of the stores so I hope they continue to carry it!
positive,"I really enjoy this tea as an afternoon treat with a little honey. I love the strawberry flavor, it doesn't taste fake or tinny."
negative,"This Tea is just the best ever. I originally bought this tea in London, I struggled to find it here. Until I found it on Amazon. I have had a subscription for about a year now. The only problem is that the last 2 shipments have been for Strawberry Sensation and not for the Original Strawberry they are both good but I prefer the Strawberry. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN? I wouldn't mind having a subscription for both, but amazon.com doesn't have the option for the Strawberry Sensation and it's shipping me the wrong type of tea. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN?"
positive,This is my favorite tea.  Who knew strawberry tea could be so juicy.  Give it a try.  You will be pleasantly surprised.
positive,This tea has a Smooth and Fruity flavor. Great flavor. Tastes like drinking strawberry jam. It's always a favorite in my tea chest.
positive,This is my favorite Ahmad Tea.  Very light strawberry flavor.  Perfect for an afternoon treat or nightime with cookies.  I order this because I can't get it locally.
positive,"Besides the fantastic taste, these are the only ice tea bags that I have been able to use in my Mr Coffee tea brewer that do not cloud up the liquid after refrigeration!"
positive,Living here in the Pacific Northwest it is hard to find this brand so I had to settle for Lipton.  When I saw this on Amazon I couldn't pass it up.  Quick delivery too.<br /><br />I make mine the sun tea way and it comes out perfect.  No bitter taste like I used to get with Lipton.  Nice color too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys their ice tea.
positive,I use these bags exclusively to make iced tea with either an iced tea pot or hot water in a reusuable bottle.  It has the best flavor of any tea on the market and amazon has the best price and quick shipping.  This is a great item for a subscription if you use as much iced tea as I do.
positive,"New Jersey equals Lipton Tea which equals yucky. I missed my southern tea.<br />Amazon, as always, saved my life. I now buy it by the case.<br />I love you Amazon and I LOVE Luzianne Tea. best in the world."
positive,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! I'm so happy with the Luzianne Iced Tea Family size tea bags. The flavor is wonderful. I had forgotten that Luzianne had Burl Ives promote this lovely tea back in the 50's-60's. Recommend to anyone who is skeptical of the price.  Well worth it...."
positive,The only tea bags we use and at this price it sure is nice having it delivered and not running out.  Love the taste!
negative,I am sorry to say this product does not live up to its positive reviews that are listed.  Lipton makes better ice tea products.  The worst part about this product is you can NOT get a refund or even a credit.  Once you have bought it.... it is yours!  I did not like the taste or brewing instructions. Amazon obviously knows something I didn't about this product......Probably explains why there isn't any recourse......or refund.....
positive,"Since we drink so much tea, I buy the best!  It is smooth and never bitter. I always make sure we have it stocked in our pantry."
positive,Love the product... Great sweet tea... And easy with the family sized tea bags. You cannot find this tea up north.
positive,"This is the best iced tea you can buy, you can't get it up here in Portland Oregon that I have found but getting on Amazon was easy and I have a casr of this great Iced Tea. Should last at least a year."
positive,"You can't get better tea than Luzianne.  Tetley, Lipton, Rose Red, etc. don't even compare.  I love the delicious Orange Pekoe/Black Tea blend because it is the perfect combination of fruity and roast flavor.  My family has been buying Luzianne for years.  I just bought a 48 pack of family size tea bags at Walmart tonight and I love how large they are.  I've been drinking almost nothing but tea and water for about a week now because I am trying to wean myself of soda.  It has the perfect amount of caffeine to not cause headaches and it is really good for you -- if you don't sweeten it.  Tea has been shown to prevent cancer and diabetes!  Brew some Luzianne and you'll never look back!<br /><br />Just a helpful tip:<br /><br />I have tried several different brewing methods -- stovetop boiling, microwave boiling, iced tea maker -- but the best one that works is just heating the water until it is hot (not boiling).  I've had problems with it coming out too strong and this is just right.  Let it steep for the full 5 minutes."
negative,"This package of six boxes of forty eight bags per box is listed in the area of large tea bags suitable for making a gallon at a time of tea.  In fact it is just small single use bags.  The box and web page says ""family size"" bags.  There is nothing family sized about single use bags.<br />This is a bad advertisement and you should not buy them.  Read these misleading ads carefully.<br />I hope this company will go out of business."
positive,They are tasty and fill you up more than you'd think. Great for staving off hunger or having a little before a meal so you don't overeat. Everything I've tried by Fiber One has been nothing short of delicious and awesome.
positive,"I love these bars.  They taste great, have a nice texture, and are very filling--especially considering only 90 calories.  Very difficult to find in stores."
negative,Product arrived melted.  Very disappointing.  Would not order again.  Much more costly than instore purchase
positive,My 2 miniature schnauzers love these treats and they are just the right size so I  dont have to worry about the fat content as these dogs dont tolerate fat content real well.
positive,"This hot sauce is one of a kind. I am always hesitant to try spicy foods because of the taste of hot sauce.. but when I tried Rocky's I was transformed. Other hot sauces seem chemically to me but Rocky's has a homey flavor that is incredibly diverse-- so much that I have been using it on eggs, tacos, as a marinade for chicken and on grilled cheese!! My family and I have been through six bottles of Rockys in the last two months. I can honestly say this is a first for our family, but certainly not the last as Rocky's has become a staple on the table for every meal. Thank You for creating such an amazing hot sauce and FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED IT: ORDER NOW!<br /><br />Lime Notes: Zingy with a fresh lime (not that awful concentrated flavor)... It goes perfectly on salad when mixed with some olive oil and chicken with a mexican twist or as a marinade for pork (that's the ways I've tried and loved it)."
positive,"I was surprised at how plump and sweet they are. These are much better than the drier non-organic red box version. Certainly it is more cost effective to buy them in larger containers such as Newman's organic raisins which are also very good, but this product meets my needs for individual packs, plus they'd be great to give out at Halloween."
positive,"My girls love raisins as a snack, so we have these on subscribe and save.  Our first batch was perfect- juicy, soft, and sweet raisins.  Kids ate them up.  This shipment, however, I have been disappointed.  Every box we've opened has been full of dry, hard, and very light colored raisins.  They still get eaten, but I'm hesitant to order again."
positive,"I was a little nervous at first, trying out this pasta, but it was DIVINE!  I looove this pasta, and have purchased all different varieties/shapes that they have.  Yes, as other person said, do not boil it for the same duration as you're used to boiling regular pasta.  Taste is EXCELLENT, and it's an added plus that they are using rice made in the US, or Can.  One of the two (I believe it was US, but can't remember which one exactly)...I called the company to inquire.  Fantastic product.  If they only made this with organic now..... :)"
positive,title says it all. Great exchange for wheat pasta. I prefer it wamr rather than cold in salads. But it is still tasty.
positive,"I bought this for my grandson (5) celiac, but we all eat it.  It is absolutely delicious.  Fool you friends and family, it tastes so much like regular wheat pasta.  And it stores wonderfully.  Great product!!"
negative,"A friend of mine was sweet enough to buy these for me when she discovered them in a tiny market, and I'm still very grateful to her for being willing to buy them (expensive pasta!) without knowing if they were any good or not.<br /><br />Even my favourite spaghetti sauce could not hide the pasty, wet-dog odour this pasta gives off -- and the ""flavour""? Forget it. Directions followed to a T, but this stuff just isn't worth it. No one at the table liked this stuff. Another disappointing gluten free pasta; don't waste your money."
positive,"I am allergic to wheat and thought i would die, Italian food was my favortie. All rice pastas are mushy and taste much like health food. This one is far better than all of the rest. The first time I had it, I actually had to check the package to make sure it was Rice and not Wheat. My husband even ate it(without knowing) and didn't notice anything. I would recommend to anyone. It is also half the price on amazon with no shipping so it pays to buy it online. Also, make sure to follow the cooking instructions and rinse very well to get all of the starch off."
positive,"We have tried all kinds of pasta -- quinoa, whole wheat, veggie, etc.  This was the first pasta where my husband and I both liked it and could hardly tell the difference with regular pasta.  We have five kids.  Three out of five can't tell the difference.  One hates all pasta and the other will eat it as long as their is sauce on it.  We make a big batch and reheat in the microwave.  It holds up nicely and doesn't dry out like regular pasta.  Highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative to regular noodles."
positive,"Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are simply some of the best imitations of wheat noodles.  Our one child has gluten sensitivities so we're switched to some alternatives.  Tinkyada is one of the best finds.  The noodles cook over a reasonable length of time (around 15-17 minutes) and have a firm texture and a taste that is quite indistinguishable from regular noodles.  We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles.  For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons.  Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles.  There is a slight taste difference when tried side by side with regular noodles but not pronounced at all unlike the yucky after taste of noodles made from bean flour."
positive,Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta.  We tried many other brands before this and most were mushy.  This pasta is excellent.  My entire family loves it!
positive,"I have tried every brand of GF pasta I can find -- stuff made from corn, rice, quinoa, you name it -- and it all has a funky aftertaste, cooks up poorly, and falls apart if reheated. NOT TINKYADA!! :-) This stuff ROCKS! My hubby is super picky and not GF, but HE LOVES TINKYADA. When I serve it to my gluten-eating friends and family, they take a bite and say, ""oh, too bad you can't eat this..."" SURPRISE! GF doesn't have to mean icky-tasting! :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) There's LOTS more great stuff from Tinkyada you can get here (and prices here beat the other online GF grocers as of 3/2008)."
positive,Have tried many products this is by far the best Rice Pasta!
positive,"In my opinion, Tinkyada is the one of the best gluten-free pastas there is. I no loger get anything else. The fettucini is wonderful as well as the spaghetti.<br />If one did not know it was not ""regular"" pasta, they would not tell the difference. It does not get mushy although it takes alittle longer to cook and you need to stir it often so it doesn't get stuck together. I ordered a case of 12 because whenver you have to have a special diet the costs in the health food stores can be outrageous, and this way you get a better price (even with shipping)"
positive,"This is a great substitute for regular pasta - doesn't go gummy and taste funny like some brands (I'm lookin' at you, DeBoles).  My significant other and a friend who often eats with us can barely tell the difference in the taste.<br /><br />It's not so great for leftovers, though - unlike regular pasta it doesn't save very well (although it does save better than most gluten free brands I've tried).  Save your leftover sauce separately and boil a new batch of pasta to serve it over."
positive,"Before being GF, my main pastas were DiCecco, a common imported brand which cooks up authentically al dente, and Barilla, which in American comes from the mid-west (not as good as the real-Italian Barilla that we don't import).  Tinkyada pasta has a pretty strong brown rice tase and a slightly off aftertaste.  The texture is a little slippery, and it disintegrates a bit while cooking.  It's still pretty good if you serve it with a sauce that you would put on a plate of brown rice, i.e., a sauce with its own texture and assertive flavor.  It's not as good if the pasta is the star of the dish.  Of the brands I've tried, Jovial is by far the best.  The brown rice taste is minimal, even nice, and it cooks more al dente than the regular wheat American brands."
positive,This is the only gluten free pasta product that I have eaten (I have eaten most of the pastatutes out there)that tastes like real pasta. Cook it according to the conserving energy method listed on the package as this delivers the best taste and texture.
positive,I'm Italian and I freaked out about pasta when I was diagnosed with celiac disease. Thankfully I found Tinkyada right away. I have an Italian neighbor and I fed it to him. He said he couldn't tell the difference. It's great stuff.
positive,I am not gluten intolerant nor is anyone in my family but we thought we'd try to reduce the amount of gluten in our diets. I tried this pasta not knowing what to expect. We actually tried the white rice version and the brown rice version (in separate dishes) and we LOVED IT. The kids couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />The one thing I did notice about it is that it is more filling than traditional pasta. So I didn't need as much pasta on my plate to be full (which I also liked). We're switching to this pasta for everything not because we have to but because we love it!
positive,"My attempts to find a healthy alternative to regular pasta were to no avail until I found this ""brown rice"" pasta in the organic section of my local Publix Supermarket. I had already tried ""whole wheat"" pasta and even though I eat, and actually prefer, whole wheat products like pizza and breads, the TEXTURE of the spaghetti was awful. I found whole wheat egg noodles and that was better, but I missed the look and twirl of spaghetti. I saw this; I like brown rice, it's organic, it looked edible as I measured it up in my mind and, alright, I put it into my shopping cart. I followed the instructions and boiled it for 16 minutes. I rinsed it well with cold water and added it to a large hot frying pan which had olive oil. After mixing for a minute and a half, I added Lucini  brand marinara and mixed it, covered it and, when hot, ate it. My review, excellent; be proud to serve and not have to apologize that it's healthy.<br />Like that old TV commercial used to say, ""Try It, You'll Like It."""
positive,I have yet to find a noodle by Tinkyada that wasn't really good.  The flavor doesn't collide with or overpower the foods you serve with them.  Other GF noodles have fallen apart but not these.  Don't be alarmed the cooking water goes cloudy but the noodles are great.
positive,These are good!  One of my Celiac children rated it better than corn pasta and one didn't.  The consistancy reminds me a little of spagettio's.  I will probably alternate between these and corn based pasta.
positive,"My husband got us this since we are avid eaters of brown rice. We love it. The secret is that it is closer to whole wheat pasta, and it does not stick together to form a big noodle bundle! If you are into wheat-free stuff, this is just for you."
positive,"My husband, who doesn't have to eat gluten-free, loves this spaghetti. Other than an awesome flavor and texture, it reheats very well, allowing leftovers to save money."
negative,"Honestly, I cant understand why this pasta gets such high marks.  I tried it and it is nowhere close to normal pasta.<br /><br />Since being told I have to be gluten free, finding a good pasta substitute has been difficult.<br />All these rice pasta brands are glue-y, sticky and slimey in texture.  this one is a little less so but it still has that wierd slimy, sticky quality.  the rice noodles are pasty colored too.  not appetizing at all.  And all this gluten free marketed stuff is hideously expensive so trying all the different brands gets costly.<br /><br />I have found the quinoa+corn based noodles to be the closest thing to real pasta -- The texture is much better.  I'm still trying to find something I can live with but so far, the quinoa pasta seems to be the most acceptable."
positive,"The reviews were so good I just had to try this - and the result was the usual fat cold noodles tasting like rice (i.e., nothing much).  Tinkyada isn't any worse than any of the others - but I find the thickness of conventional spaghetti makes the rice taste much more noticeable.  Take this with a grain of salt, since I preferred vermicelli even before I went on a gluten-free diet (about 15 years ago), but to me, vermicelli works a lot better than conventional spaghetti, because it's thinner, making the taste (or lack thereof) less noticeable when coated with sauce.  People not on the diet notice the pasta when I use rice spaghetti, but no one has ever found fault with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLXSS"">Ener-G Foods Rice Vermicelli, 10.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> I used to use, or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IAIOS"">Annie Chun's Brown Rice Noodle, Pad Thai, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> (more like linguini) I've been using in place of spaghetti recently.  I still buy the Tinkyada spaghetti to use in soups - fine for chicken noodle soup, etc. - but am going back to the above products that I've been using quite happily as spaghetti for years.  Not only is the rice taste less noticeable, but the vermicelli cooks in 4 minutes or so - 1/3 the time it takes to cook Tinkyada spaghetti.  (Given my attention span, this also makes it easier for me not to forget and overcook it into a gooey mess.)"
positive,"I really have to question the bias of the people who wrote the previous 25 reviews.  They must have been Tinkyada employees, friends, or family because there is no way that it tastes five-stars.<br /><br />To be fair, I do eat gluten and it is my wife who has the gluten allergy.  So I do have my own biases as I eat gluten on a daily basis.  My wife tells me that she forgets what gluten tastes like after months of going on the gluten-free diet, and she is able to eat alternatives that I believe do not taste as good as the wheat-full version.  However, my wife is not particularly fond of this product either.<br /><br />Based on the reviews, I bought this thinking this spaghetti was going to taste exactly the same as regular pasta, but the consistancy, though constant, is kind of slimy.  Additionally, the ""energy saving method"" turns the pasta especially gooey, so I do not recommend that method of cooking should you be persuaded based on the other 25 reviews.<br /><br />There are lots of other gluten-free pastas out there, like corn-based, or a mixture of potato, soy, and rice that taste a lot closer to the ""real-thing.""  I haven't found too many alternatives on Amazon yet, but my local grocery store has a few and my wife prefers them over this brand.  So at the moment, I have 11 packets of gluten-free spaghetti that I would be happy to get rid of."
positive,"Most of the grocery stores in my neighborhood sell this product, so I've been buying it locally for the past year. I really enjoyed it up until recently.<br />Tonite, I realized there are two things I don't like about this pasta.<br />#1 - It takes too long to cook.  I have to boil it for at least 20 minutes to get it the texture I like.  That's a long time when you can boil angel hair pasta in 6 minutes and stir fry some veggies in less than 2 miinutes.<br />#2 - Even after 20 minutes of boiling, this pasta is super AL DENTE.  It just always seems like it's not cooked enuf.<br />I wish they had a thin angel hair version.<br />I couldn't even finish my dinner tonite.  After boiling 20 minutes, this stuff was just too hard. It was almost as gross as eating UNDERCOOKED rice.  Yes, it is gluten-free, but, it's got a thick, starchy texture that I can't stand chewing and it takes too long to cook.<br />IMHO, corn-quinoa pasta is better.<br /><br />Edit:  6-28-12<br />Tinkyada's FETTUCCINI in the red package is better."
negative,"Based on reviews, I tried this pasta. It may have been better than some other brands, but it certainly didn't taste good. The only gluten-free pasta that I think tastes like ""real"" pasta is made by Bionature--both their penne and their spaghetti are terrific."
positive,"This deal is the best deal I can find for this name of pasta.  I'm trying gluten free, and this fits easily into the budget.  Taste great or better than regular (wheat) pasta."
negative,"I bought this thinking it would be nice to eat a spaghetti that was gluten free and not expensive. I bought a few packages because I always follow the package directions first, then I play with it if it's not to my liking.<br /><br />Attempt 1 was like eating a gummy spaghetti noodle with a nasty after taste. I had to add sauce and butter to kill the taste.<br /><br />Attempt 2 wasn't any better. It was still gummy and gluey like and the flavor wasn't very good either.<br /><br />Attempt 3 was a little better in that the water didn't look like a gelatin style mess when we drained it but the noodles were chewy and I couldn't finish the second bite.<br /><br />Attempt 4 was when I finally said no more ""pasta joy"". I ended up trying to cook it by breaking the noodles in half first, thinking maybe it just isn't that great for cooking as long noodles. Oh no. I ended up having to take out clumps of noodles, tear them apart from each other and put them back in the pot. I gave up towards the end and just threw the clumps of noodles out. The texture was slimy, gummy and sticky and the aftertaste is still like pet food.<br /><br />If you are used to over cooked spaghetti drowned in sauce, I could see how this would be great... But if you want something that tastes and acts like spaghetti, this is NOT it.<br /><br />I can't figure out how this got 5 stars. It was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti. I bought Hodgkins Mills rice and flaxseed noodles and they are perfect in texture and taste. But I won't buy pasta joy again."
positive,"This stuff takes awhile to ccok, but it doesn't turn to mush when you cook it! Holds up really well in soups, slow cooker meals and pasta main dishes (both hot and cold). Nice flavor, too.<br /><br />Before I ate gluten-free, I used to eat 100% whole wheat pasta. This is nowhere near as flavorful (and is softer in texture), but I've gotten used to it. If you like white/refined/semolina wheat pasta, there will be less adjusting to do (regarding taste.) This pasta definitely has more flavor than white rice pastas, and it really does hold up much better in cooking."
positive,For those looking for a delicious brown rice pasta Tinkyada is the best.  I've tried just about every brand and Tinkyada is the best.  My family loves it.  We choose to eat this pasta as opposed to wheat pasta to be healthier.  It cooks up good.  And buying from Amazon is great.  We can buy large quantities at a substantial discount.
positive,"We tried this pasta on a whim when grocery shopping one day.  No one in our family eats a gluten-free diet or anything, it was purely an impulse buy.  Wow- was this a good purchase!  I fed our whole family (6 including 3 teenagers) with this one bag and we had a lot leftover.  It is of such high quality that it filled everyone up on less than traditional white pasta AND they couldn't stop talking about how good it taste!  I used this brand's mini-shells for a dish a few nights ago and again- THEY COULDN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HOW GOOD IT WAS!! This will now be our pasta of choice as the flavor and value (because less fills up everyone)from now on!  Can't say enough!"
positive,"Tankyada spaghettis are first quality. My husband has celiac disease and has to eat a gluten free diet, which can be a real pain. We have purchased other brands of pasta before. They turned into mush and were very sticky.<br />So we purchased Tankyada spaghettis from Amamzon, and we are thrilled.<br />They don't stick together and are easy to serve, if one follows the directions. My advice is: If there are leftovers, please, rinse them in cold water again, drain and store in the refrigerator.<br />I hope my review will help others."
positive,"This pasta has a great taste and texture.  It is very similar to ""regular"" pasta.  My husband, who does not have celiac, enjoys it too."
positive,"This tastes better than spaghetti that is made with wheat.  Gluten free is more expensive, but I got this at a good price.  Will buy more when I am finished with this."
positive,"I've started buying this in bulk from Amazon because it seems to be the only GF pasta that works.  Others fall apart or are simply awfultasting in addition to being overpriced. I have to keep telling my mother in law not to buy the little $4 a bag GF pasta she buys because I've found the one that works.  If you follow the ""energy saving"" method, it works even better.  That way the pasta isn't torn up by all the boiling."
positive,"We adore all of Tinkyada's products, their pasta keeps it's shape far better than any other pasta rice product we have tried. Friends are never able to tell it isn't a traditional pasta product. I served a cold Rotini salad made with Tinkyada pasta at our BBQ last night and no one knew it was Gluten Free, they all said it was delicious. A guest who was also on a Gluten Free diet said she couldn't believe it was really GF - she has been so disappointed with other rice pastas and was happy I'd discovered the Tinkyada line of products."
positive,"Being gluten free can be a challange to find products that can be fun to eat not just a substitute that reminds you that you are being deprived of what everyone else eats. So far, (and I have tried several) Tinkyada is the only GF pasta that I have found that is close in texture and fun as wheat spaghetti and I am including other pasta shapes in this review. My husband even likes it and I have served GF pasta with chicken and sauce over it to guests and they were suprised it was GF. It doesn't bloat you like wheat pasta. You just feel comforatbly full after a big wad of ""sketti"". One downside of any of the GF pastas is that they are stiff and breakable when cold so it is hard to use them for cold pasta salad. However, I had some that I had overcooked a little and that seemed to work pretty well for cold salad. You will have to experiment for yourself with that. At any rate, I would definitely suggest you try the spaghetti especially if you have a child who is gluten free. Also the pasta will make great mac and cheese."
positive,This pasta is GOOD!  You really can't tell much difference from wheat.  I was surprised.  I'm fairly new to the world of gluten free eating and have not been won over by products other people say are tasty.  My taste buds haven't become accustomed to many years of wheat free living yet but they gave this product two thumbs up!
positive,"Product was exactly as advertised.  It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.<br />The taste is spot on.  I put a few drops of the pure maple extract, along with a couple of drops of pure vanilla extract in my oatmeal (with 1/4 chopped walnuts) every morning.  It's a great way to start the day. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QQA4KK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
positive,"Love, love, love this coffee!  It is the perfect roast for breakfast.  If it's not good coffee I won't drink it.  And I love this one."
positive,This product is a great value for the money.  A great way to sample these coffees and share with friends!
negative,"I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet.  These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones.  They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans.  The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops."
positive,My dog loves them. I give her one when I leave for work. She not only enjoys the treat but it cleans her teath and keeps her busy so she doesn't notice my leaving as much.
positive,"Mollie, my Aussie Shepherd mix, loves Greenies.  And I like that the lite is better for her--even though she is an active dog.  We've not had any problems with her chewing or digesting them--as others have.  She loves the taste, but eats them slowly enough to make the bits small pieces.  And I value how they clean her teeth.  All in all, we love them, but I watch her while she eats; I wouldn't put them in her kennel while I was away."
negative,It doesn't really clean up the smell from my dogs' mouths. They love Greenies so much because Greenies got by-products in the ingredients which taste really good but doesn't do good job for the breath. I would recommend Halo's dental chew than Greenies.
positive,"Greenies were recommended to me by a friend, and I love them for my dogs!  Greenies really help with bad breath!  My dogs LOVE THEM!"
positive,"I use a ton of ""greenies"" or other dental products for my little dog (a 7 lb Yorkie/Maltese mix.)  She used to hate it when I left the house, so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only.  However, she was started to get a little chunky, so thought switching her to the ""light"" version  might be a better option.  I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system, but I've seen no problem thus far, and I've been using them for over a week.  She doesn't seem to notice a difference at all, and I feel comfortable knowing I'm not overfeeding her (in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place!) I would definitely recommend this product."
positive,"We have two yorkies, one is very picky and one whom we nicknamed a porkie yorkie will eat anything.<br />They both love these. We do not give them one everyday, because we like to give them variety. We do treat them like our kids. The Lite is for the tubby little one, she is 4 and the picky one is 12. They are so spoiled that we have at least 10 different treats for them to keep them happy. And boy it is hard to find treats made in USA!  We have been giving our babies these treats since our 12 year old was a puppy, the vet says she has the best teeth of any 12 year old yorkie she has ever seen. The little one is no slouch either.<br />But Yorkies are nortorious for getting bad teeth. Not ours. They love the greenies and the teenie lites are perfect for their after our dinner treats. And made in America. How much better can you get then that? Your pets are important, treat them  to a greenie!"
positive,Not a bad tasting tea!! And actually does seem to help with appetite suppressing. Good value for money.
positive,"This stuff is great!  I was nervous about the taste at first, but it's awesome!  I put a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of Splenda sugar Blend in it and it is just yummy!  Thank you for your fast delivery too!"
positive,This is the only tea that I will drink.  It has an amazing taste.  I have been ordering this product for some time and can always rely on value as well as the flavor.
positive,Love the tea it helps with my hunger pains and my metabolism Would recommend this to everyone .  Thank You
positive,"This is a very good tasting tea that steeps nicely into a light colored beverage. However, about 50% of the bags had tears in them or were otherwise unsealed.  I would buy again only as loose tea, as that is basically what came.  :-)"
negative,I have purchased this tea before and just love it but my latest purchase have inferior bags.  They break no matter how carefully you place them into the hot water or pour over.  The former bags were not the flow thru type and never broke.  These flow thru bags are very thin and cheaply made.  The tea still tastes great.
positive,"I'm kind of an amateur when it comes to tea, but I've tried several kinds of oolong tea, mostly because of the supposed visceral fat-burning benefits.  [I can't really comment on the fat burning because I'm also dieting and exercising.]  But I can comment on the flavor of the tea.  I use one tea bag in an insulated mug of about 14 ounces, add a heaping teaspoon of Splenda, and leave it in the mug as I drink it over two to three hours.  Probably not the best way to drink tea, I know. Nevertheless, this tea has a good, moderately strong, pleasant flavor; holds its flavor; and does not have a bitter aftertaste like some of the others I have tried.  Best of all, this was very economical [$7 for a hundred bags, and eligible for free Prime shipping].  I highly recommend this tea and plan to buy it again.  Do watch to make certain it is specifically this brand and kind, since Foojoy has several that sound similar and I have tried one of the others that I did not like as well.  [...]"
negative,"Most of the bags were broken and unusable... however, I eventually found a good bag and brewed some of this tea, and it was dreadful. It has tons of floating powder in it, and really sticks in your throat. The flavor is bitter and acrid, and nothing like what I have ever had in any Chinese restaurant. It's truly awful."
negative,"I usually do not leave negative reviews. But I was so excited to order this tea at such a good price. I ordered two boxes. One for me and another for my friend. Well, I would just like to say that this was the worst experience I ever had with an online order. I ordered two boxes of this tea and only received one. Then I got one box of the tea, me thinking this is weired. I sent an email to the company. I had to wait at least 2 1/2 weeks to get a response from my email. Granted, the owner emailed me back and said he was out of the country and did apologize. His wife was helping him. The thing is, if the help is not good or don't know what they are doing. It is like leaving your business on auto pilot and hoping nothing goes wrong! Well it did, things went terribly wrong! I did not even try the tea. The box I did get I just put it to the side. The owner did refund my money for the one box I never got, I thank you for that to say the least. But over all next time please do not leave you business unmanned. The results are not good at all!"
negative,I have been drinking Costa Rican Coffee for years. What came out of this bag was too bland to be Costa Rican.. Or maybe just too old.
negative,"Sorry to say I was disappointed with this coffee.  Costa Rican is one of my favorites and I guess I should have known better than to buy already ground, but they were out of whole bean so I thought what the heck!  When I opened the bag and hardly smelled any aroma I had my first clue something was amiss...then when my husband said it tasted like swill...that sealed the deal.  Can't recommend"
negative,"I ordered this on 7/30/12. It came on 8/25/12 (not super fast, but not unreasonable coming from India). I wanted to be excited to get this product, but was initially worried about my cardamom because the small cardboard box was very warped and appeared as though it had gotten quite wet at some point. I hoped that the product inside had been packaged in a way that allowed it to remain dry. Boy was I disappointed (I've bought on amazon for years, and this is my very first review. Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it. This is a poor practice when shipping from so far. I cannot tell if the cardamom would have been fresh otherwise, I will not order again."
negative,I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.
positive,"My daughter and I both have celiac and these are my favorite gluten-free cookies. I loved ginger snaps and molasses cookies before I was diagnosed with celiac and this are a lovely indulgence in a sparce market. I dip them in milk, my daughter eats them plain. Good texture too!"
positive,We know a lot about GF producs in my house and my son really likes these cookies.  They are good Oreo substitutes.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie part is very hard and brittle.
positive,"My 5 yr. old son (Tyler) who is Autistic and had to go on the GF diet likes them very much. I found these cookies at Liz' Healthfood in Conway, AR. They taste almost like an Oreo. Great cookie."
positive,These are the best gluten free cookies ever.  If you have had the real thing before you won't know the difference.  Even my friends that aren't allergic to gluten like these cookies.
negative,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
negative,"These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left."
negative,"Hard as a rock.  Some companies are able to make gluten free sweets palatable, but these are really not very good.  Soaked a cookie in milk for 5 minutes and it did not soften."
negative,"We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems."
negative,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
positive,"I really struggled  finding a decent replacement for Oreo's. This is the closest thing I've found. It is a bit more grainy, due to the rice flour but the crispness is there and the chocolaty sweet taste of and Oreo is satisfied. Use it for recipes as well."
positive,"Good tasting cookie.  Will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Very hard, though.  Definitely good for dunking in your coffee!"
negative,THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.<br /><br />SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.<br /><br />FOR ME I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.........
negative,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
positive,"REALLY ENJOY THE 'SNAPPY GINGER' TASTE IN MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE GINGER SNAPS.<br />THIS CASE SEEMED TO ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5-8 WHOLE, IN TACT COOKIES IN EACH PACKAGE.  THEY WERE MOSTLY GINGER SNAP CRUMBS!<br />I HAVE ORDERED THESE GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES OFTEN AND THE MOSTLY CRUMBS WAS A FIRST.  I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH OTHER MI-DEL GLUTEN-FREE COOKIES I HAVE ORDERED IN THE PAST.<br />HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I WILL ORDER A CASE OF THEM AGAIN."
positive,"I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead."
positive,"We love these cookies, better than ""K"" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the ""K"" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the ""K"" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price."
positive,"These are so tasty! Just the perfect amount of sweetness! They are nicely brown around the edges, so delicious!"
positive,"Mi-Del Gluten-Free Ginger Snaps are the only gluten free cookies I've found that I would put on par with really good regular cookies. Besides a taste that I enjoy, they have a nice slightly chewy texture. You'll be doing double takes to make sure the label actually says gluten-free."
positive,"These are the best ""wheat"" free cookeis.<br />This was a great price and availabiltiy.<br />Would love to business again! Thanks."
positive,"The flavor of my first bite was unbelievably intense.  I've tried numerous GF cookies, these are my favorite by a long shot. The package has been redesigned, it is now cream & blue in color."
positive,"To date, this is the only gluten free cookie I've tried and absolutely loved.  They have a livelier flavor than vanilla wafers and are sweeter (but not too sweet) than what you expect from regular animal crackers.  I subscribed to these and am glad they come in the bulk quantity they do, since even my gluten-loving coworkers devour them as soon as they see they're out for taking."
positive,"Delicious? Check!<br />Gluten free? Check!<br />Good price? Check!<br /><br />Thank you, amazon, for making these great cookies available!  It is difficult finding things to eat when you have a gluten intolerance and it is even HARDER finding things to eat that TASTE GOOD!<br /><br />All of the celiacs in my family enjoy these animal crackers! Five stars!"
positive,My son loves these cookies! They're tasty and reasonable-2 traits which often don't describe gluten free baked goods! Enjoy!
positive,Very good gluten free animal cookies... We use them as re-inforcers for my son.  Very good product.
negative,This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.
positive,"These are spicy, and my kids love them too. They are crispy and I am SO glad I found these after being diagnosed with Celiac."
positive,"Thanks to hubby's recent diagnosis of gluten allergy, I've begun to explore the world of gluten free foods. While some are quite bland, these little cookies pack a flavorful punch! Nothing ""depriving"" here."
negative,"I ordered these for my son (age 11). He doesn't like them at all. I thought they would be similar to the Kinnikinnick cookies we get at our local health food store, but they're not. These are rock hard and although sugary, otherwise have no flavor. We'll stick with the Kinnikinnicks. I'm just hoping maybe I can use these for making a cookie crumb crust."
positive,These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free!  The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much.  2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen)  Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...
positive,"Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)<br /><br />Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavor<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6"">Nature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.<br /><br />My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire."
positive,"Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."
positive,"Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family."
negative,"Sadly, the cookies in this shipment  were soft (they should be crunchy).  I now only buy them from the store self where they are fresh."
negative,"If you are looking for mild ginger flavored snaps...these are not it.  If you however, enjoy a very strong ginger taste, give these a try."
negative,"These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste.  I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it."
negative,"Took FOREVER to arrive and the case is way too many cookies to consume! Will stick to my local organic grocery next time. Once again, ordering food from Amazon has fallen far below expectations."
positive,"I was looking for a good tea to replace some excellent Sencha I picked up in japan. This tea is very good - maybe not quite the quality of the tea I got in Japan, but it's still quite good.<br /><br />The size of the tin is a little misleading, there is a sealed mylar bag of tea within the tin, and if you dumped it out into the tin, it would barely fill it half way."
positive,"Add the eggs, butter, milk, and whatever you want to fill it with and you can become an instant culinary genius."
positive,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee."
positive,"For those who like a bit more flavor than the soft breakfast blends -- this is the best of the bunch.  I have worked through most brand ""bolds"" and come back to this one every time.  Black Tiger is similar but does not have some of the added flavor notes found here."
positive,"I use this stuff like it was ketchup, honestly. It goes with everything. Hoisin is awesome on chinese food, thai food, vietnamese food, its good with hamburgers, fries, and even with steak instead of steak sauce. Hoisin is sweet, and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments. The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook, and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color, and Yan Can do no wrong with me!!!!"
positive,"I love, love, love the Nanami Togarashi seasoning.  Having moved away from a Yoshinoya restaurant, I missed it so much.  I contacted Yoshinoya and asked where I could purchase the seasoning and they directed me to Amazon.  I was so thrilled I ordered three!  This stuff is great on rice, chow mein, chicken, beef, and more.  I liberally sprinkle it on many things I eat.  In fact, I sneak it into restaurants in my purse and sprinkle it on my food.  I know that must sound insane but that's how much I love this product.  The price is right, too.  I could go on forever about it but I won't.  Just try it!"
positive,"I love this stuff...I make baked sweet potato fries and use this to season them. RECIPE: slice three sweet potatoes into large strips, toss them in 2T olive oil, bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, using a spatula turn them and bake another 25 minutes. Mix 1 Teaspoon Togarashi, 1 Teaspoon sugar (or stevia), 1/2 Teaspoon salt. Toss the potatoes in this mixture and voila! We are crazy about them and they are so good for us."
positive,"This is the same red little bottle you'll see in Japanese restaurants in Japan and the US, with a key ingredient substituted out. I've always heard it called ""shichimi"", the alternate pronunciation of seven (nana). There are 7 spices in here. In Japan, the mix contains hemp seed, which has been replaced in the US market with orange peel.<br /><br />It's great over yakitori skewers, pizza, ramen, or anything you want to add a little dash of flavor too. Spiciness is very very mild."
positive,I grew up on S&B Togarashi and have tried many other togarashi products in an attempt to find an easier source of this wonderful spice.  None of the other brands and sources measured up.  I now purchase S&B Togarashi in case lots here on Amazon!
positive,"I ordered this spice after having dinner at Roy's in Naples, FL.  They serve edamame with a version of this spice.  This is very good but not exactly what we had.  I use this spice now for an assortment of menus and it makes everything taste better.  Not very spicy so everyone likes it."
positive,"I'd read about this product and while in an Asian market quite a distance away I decided to buy some to give it a try.  I now have four bottles as a back-up, ordering thru Amazon, which is much cheaper than several hours worth of gas.  I gave some as a gift to a buddy, and he's really enjoyed it ... he's a ""believer"".  This goes with almost anything, though some things are more suitable than others.  It's got some zip, but it's not too hot.  If you haven't tried it, do so ... it's a treat."
positive,"First, I'm a wimp when it comes to hot peppers. This seasoning is a perfect blend of peppers & other spices. it adds just the right amount of heat. I add it to many of my dishes and it always enhances it. Especially, if my dish turned out a little sweeter than I wanted it. This spice evens it out. Of course, the more you use the hotter it is. Go light, taste & sprinkle more if needed. You can always add but you can't take it out once it's in there. My whole family likes it."
positive,I discovered this stuff at a restaurant in Singapore and fell in love with the flavor; use it on everything now whenever I have it. What I cant get my head around is why they dont sell it in larger bottles; I can go thru 1 of these a week.
positive,"I'm crazy about this spice! I only recently bought a bottle just because I liked the way it looked mostly... and now I'm totally addicted. It is the perfect amount of heat. I'm almost out of it and can't remember the store that I bought it at. So glad that Amazon carries it. I sprinkle it on everything including spinach salads, deviled eggs,  corn on he cob and mangos. Even good on watermelon."
positive,This is abolutley the best and tastiest mix of all. Wonderful by its self. Love it on home made hamburgers instead of lettuce.
positive,"Bob's Red Mill is always of the highest quality and i always choose their brand over any other.  That being said I must emphatically say that Soy Flour is pretty darn nasty tasting.  I suggest that if you are going to use it, blend it in with other flours (if you can).  you can probably get used to the taste, but kinda leaves an aftertaste that is unpleasant to me at least. good luck!"
negative,"These waffles tasted ""blah"". The ""waffle"" part was more like a bad cookie and the chocolate is sub par.  I was very hopeful that these would be good and some what healthy as the package says no sugar. It's high calorie for a ""cookie"" and terrible tasting. I will not purchase again."
positive,"I usually order the Organic Nature Select Applesauce from Gerber, however I thought that this is the same product, only DHA enhanced.  The DHA is derived from Tuna Oil which is not so bad, however it also contains Gelatin, derived from pork, not vegetables!.  The product ingredients above does not state that, and is very misleading.  I didn't notice this until my 3 year old ate 3 containers of it!  I ended up throwing out the rest of the box that was purchased."
positive,"We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an ""organic pear-only"" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is ""cooked"" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!"
negative,"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?"

positive,Its taste and smell is good.<br />Maybe my Babe likes the strawberry in it.<br />We have taken several types of Gerber 2nd foods.
negative,"When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has ""organic"" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product ""does not have harmful levels of mercury.""  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish."

positive,"Same food as in the store, but delivered right to your door.  This came in handy when we were nearly out of baby food and didn't have time to go to the store.  Two days later, a package of food arrived.  Very convenient."

positive,"yum, yum. yum!!!!  have ordered these often, for birthday parties, funeral, `I Love You'.  It is a lot of candy & can be shared for a long time."
negative,"I LOVE foie gras in pretty much any form, however its honestly not for anyone on a budget or middle class for sure. I decided to go with grade B because of the $30 difference. I assumed it with just be veinier. It was veinier but also lacked that great earthy duck taste that you get with grade A and with the canned product. I felt like i was eating chicken liver or something. It wasnt worth the price. I suggest you continue to splurge on grade A. But if you are making a pate' then grade B might suffice- hope this helps"
positive,"Great product! This dog food has a very healthy rating from professional canine associations..  My Jack Russell loves the taste,  the price is right and the shipper very reliable."
positive,"These candies are addicting~!......down here in Miami they are only available in certain neighborhood, so this tub was perfect. You won't be disappointed if you  like coconut and caramel...."
positive,This candy is hard to find in stores nowadays. Long Boys were packaged well. They were fresh and as good as I remember. I'm glad I purchased them.
positive,"This is my favorite candy from way back, I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.com The candy was very fresh, it was shipped really fast and the quantity was just right, enough to have on hand for quite a while before its time to re-order."
negative,Unfortunately the product is packed in a box that is not substantial enough to protect the crackers from breaking in transit.  Only about half of the crackers in each package remain in tact.  The cost is a really good deal as long as you don't need the crackers to be in tact.
negative,"While the product itself is a great tasting gluten free food. Amazon did not securely ship these fragile crackers. The package comes in a case of 12. When the box arrived to my home, ten of the trays where completely crushed into tiny cracker fragments. Amazon did not make the effort to enclose the crackers in a safe shipping box. And when I looked into returning the crackers, the website informed me that this was a non-returnable product. After further searching on the Amazon website, to find a way to return a damaged product, and not having any luck, I gave up. I ended up using the crackers as cracker crumbles in soups and such - This was not my initial intent. Based on this one bad experience, I will never order another food item through Amazon again."
positive,These are great and totally adictive. I agree with other reviews that unfortuantly they do often come a bit broken but I can live with that. The alternative would be to have massives of packaging to protect them and surely we don't want any more excessive packaging.<br />Let's not encourage suppliers to do that. What's a broken cracker compared to a broken planet?<br />I just save the whole ones for entertaining and enjoy the broken ones as my snack! They are delicious whole or broken!
positive,"These are yummy. Black sesame, cheddar, and vegetable flavors are all excellent, low fat, and gluten free. Hard to find in local grocery stores around here at least...."
positive,"Good taste, great crunch, some broken crackers, just a little too salty (for me) to use with dips that are also plenty salty.  I think I'll try the unsalted organic brown rice snaps since the unsalted sesame brown rice snaps are discontinued."
positive,"I love these crackers.  They are my absolute favorite, I was so happy to find them on Amazon for a good price, and so sad to have them arrive mostly broken.  If they were just broken in half I wouldn't mind, but the debris is (for the most part) inedible."
positive,"Hey couch potatoes and lovers of pure food!  These are dynamite crackers!  Get 'em!  They are made with rice flour, so all of you who need to avoid gluten can enjoy them.  They are unique and delicious.  Gormet and organic.  And the case price is perfect.  The only problem is that they do arrived a bit broken up.  :-(  It seemed that about 1/3 of the crackers were not in whole pieces.  We could live with this, especially for the price, but some folks might find that offensive.  However, we LOVE these crackers and will order them again.  They are not available in our local stores, so ordering them from amazon.com is the way to go for us."
negative,"I bought these expecting a replacement for my beloved but discontinued Van Houtte Kenya Kilimandjaro K-Cups. Those were dark, robust, and fruity with plenty of flavor to stand up to cream.<br /><br />Well, these are not close at all. At best, it is a medium roast and cream just dilutes the flavor. Maybe OK if you drink your coffee black, but not all Kenyan coffees are the same. If it didn't say ""Extra Bold,"" I would not have guessed this was an Extra Bold K-Cup; the flavor just isn't there."
positive,My husband and I really enjoyed this coffee and were disappointed when I couldn't find it again to purchase on Amazon.  Hope it comes back cuz it's really a great coffee.
negative,"Unless I'm missing where this is for 2 boxes or something, this is WAY overpriced!  You can buy this directly from Keurig for $15, $13 is you're a member!  Do people really fall for this?  Amazon, why do you let them get away with it?"
negative,"If you like ginger, there is not much here. We were trying to find large ginger pieces surrounded by chocolate like that found at a small candy store in Hilo. These were nothing like that. Look for an Australian supplier."
positive,"This is the only treat my Red Persian will eat.  She is very large, and will eat everything in sight from the other cats in my home,  But this treat is the only one for her.  If I put out something else for the other cats, she will leave it alone, and wait for this one.  I'll be in Big trouble if this is ever discontinued."
positive,"Looking forward to the tasty results, but these cannot be used in a hotair popper. We tried them in our our new Presto and they just fell out in to the bowl uncooked. Called Presto; they immediately knew what was wrong - ""Are you using a gourmet corn that is small? There is not enough weight for them to be exposed to the hot air long enough......!"" This is not the seller's fault but be aware you can't pop these in - at least - a Presto hotair popper."
positive,"I could not disagree more with the other reviewer!  I think that this is the best popcorn.  Purple, Red and Baby Whites are my favorites.  I can't even eat Orville since having this.  There is just no comparison. Worth every penny and then some!"
positive,"This was a gift to my grandson (7) and he loves it, especially the colors.  He is a Cub Scout and the Pack sold popcorn, but my son thought having different colors to experiment for him after the sales would be fun to have.  I'm sure he will want more when the bags are all eaten.<br /><br />This was a Verified Amazon Purchase"
positive,Very tender and light popcorn. I use the Back to Basics stainless steel stove top popcorn popper.
positive,"I was looking for popcorn with less hulls.  Have been using Oroville R's microwave popcorn for years and have noticed more and more hulls which are not great for the teeth!  I found the Amish country popcorn somewhat as advertised.  The purple were tasty with larger kernels.  However, the smaller kernels did poorly in air popper.  Kernels kept flying out because of being so much smaller and lighter weight.  Did like the taste and give an A+ for less hulls."
positive,"Our family loves popcorn.  The Amish Country Popcorn is wonderful...tender, tasty and delightful.  We love the nearly hull less kernels and the tiny size of the popped product.  So good to enjoy while watching movies or even just curling up and reading a good book."
negative,Save your money.<br />Go buy yellow or white popcorn from your local grocery store (under a $1.00 a lb.).<br />They are charging $4.80 a pound here.<br />I found two of the three verities they are selling here are no more than yellow and white popcorn which cost less than $1.00 a lb. at your local grocery store.<br />Their third verity here the 'Purple' has no significant different taste or flavor than yellow or white popcorn.<br />Popcorn is popcorn after being popped.<br />Also save your money on their caramel topping. You are just buying brown sugar.<br />They are charging ($11.58) for a 10 oz. jar of what amounts to brown sugar.<br />A 2 lb. bag of brown sugar is around $2.00 at your local grocery store.<br />By the way brown sugar a very good popcorn topping in my opinion.  As good as I have found.<br />So there you are.<br />My opinion for what it's worth.
negative,"This does not work in a hot Air Popper.  It is light in weight and size. and the hot air blows it out of the popper.  Might be okay for other type of poppers, but not Hot Air, like the Presto Units."
negative,you cant use an air popper for these because they are to small and just fly out I dont know how they taste I gave them away to a friend who had a kettle popper
negative,Popcorn tastes OK -- but the kernal pop way too small.  It's like a whole bowl of the bottom of the tub of popcorn crumbs.  Regular Orville Redenbacher popcorn is much better
positive,"I won't be ordering again.  Maybe it is my popcorn popper, but there was too many un-popped hulls in every batch that I used.  Could be they weren't very fresh."
negative,After popping the Amish Country corn I found many hulls that did not pop.  The corn wasn't very fluffy and tough to eat.
negative,"I had expected a large popped pot of popped corn but what I received after popping was a ""fresh, but small popped kernals. They were rather tasteless. I still have 2 3/4 lbs. left and probably will seek another brand."
negative,"One of three packages, LADY FINGER TYPE,  was inedible and did not pop. Could not determine until used other two types which were ok."
negative,"I am disappointed in this product. For reasons unknown to me, it doesn't pop well at all in my electric air popper.<br />I've never had a problem with other brands. Perhaps it has to do with the small size of the kernels. But rather than pop, they pretty much just fly around the kitchen...unpopped!!"
positive,"I don't pretend to be a popcorn expert but either fresh or even  a few days old, salted, I'll eat it. Of the three offered in this package, I don't have a favorite. They are all tasty in their own way."
positive,"This popcorn is sweeter and more flavorful than the cheapo brand we used to buy at the store. I'm hooked. My favorite is the purple, but I usually mix all three together and that's just as good. Tastes excellent and is healthy when cooked in expeller pressed coconut oil."
positive,"I love popcorn and eat it almost everyday. Great source of fiber and low in calories. I never had Amish popcorn before, so when I ordered the popper, this was recommended. Will be ordering more and different kinds."
negative,When I bought my popcorn popper I figured I'd try this popcorn just to see how it was.  Please dont waste your money on this stuff.  The colonels were very very small and tough.  I thought maybe since it was my first time using it  wud try it again in case it was me with a new popper....and again it was awful.  Threw the popped popcorn out and even the birds wudnt eat it....
negative,I purchased an airpop popcorn maker.  This is a small kernal popcorn that did poorly in the machine.  Kernals were flying out and many didn't pop.
negative,"I was ripped off! Promised a superior product. I purchased the medium yellow, small kernals, lots unpopped, flavor: below average, texture: odd sandy. would love to get my money back for this obvious tourist trap crap."
negative,I was looking forward to the popcorn and was disappointed it never arrived.  Possibly it is back ordered.  Hoping to have fresh pop corn soon.
negative,not at all worth the cost...purchased a great hot air popper and used this corn in it...tried all three varieties with same results...popcorn was stale and tasteless...using Orville from now on.
positive,This was a very nice gift for my mother and father in law. They really enjoyed it!
positive,"If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird"
positive,"Lijjat Papad is the only brand I trust to consistently perform well for me. I tend to roast mine over an open flame (god bless gas stoves!), but my sister-in-law likes to do hers in the microwave. It's the papad that my mother bought in India, and it's the one that I buy in New York. We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat. I have a lot of friends over, so I tend to run through papad fairly quickly."
negative,We ordered the twenty pack and split it with another household.  No one could eat them.  They tasted like plastic.  We tried several from a few different packages and had the same results.
positive,"This stuff is great, my kids love it!  No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.  I make 5L at a time, one of each flavor and it is always a hit."
positive,"I was dissapointed with this product's retail price.  While the bitter taste known to accomplany stevia was reduced in this product, I felt that there just wasn't enough powder to make it worth the cash compared to other non-aspartame based powdered drinks out on the market.  The usage directions are abysmal on the bottle, so I went with what most people stated here and started with a small quantity of powder.  I blended it very well using a blendy bottle, which is a 28oz bottle that contains a coiled circular spring inside that slices through the water, stirring with every shake.  While I can't comment on how well it tastes if you mix and let settle for long periods of time, I never had an issue with clumping or not having enough flavor.<br /><br />As for flavors, all I bought were pretty tasty.  I ordered cherry, orange, lemon-lime, strawberry, and grape all at once when there was a decent sale going.  this was in september 2009.<br /><br />Even though you don't need much powder to get a good taste, the company doesn't give any estimation as to how much you should use or how much a bottle makes.  With that in mind at the price its at, I find it hard to give this product more than 3 stars.  If it was four dollars I'd think it was a steal and easily give another star, as I estimate each jar will make upwards of 2-3 gallons, maybe more if used sparingly. at $9.95, sorry, I just can't.  I'm back to my old ways of using a touch of stevia from packets to sweeten my water and topping it off with whichever citrus fruits are on sale (a squeeze of lemon, lime, or orange for flavor)."
positive,"This product is delicious, not to mention all-natural, and I use it almost every single day.  I mix it into plain yogurt and it makes it downright addictive. I'm slowly collecting all the flavors of Stevita (I only wish there were more!!) and this one might just be my favorite; it's the perfect balance of sweetness and authentic strawberry flavor!"
positive,"This stuff makes a very mildly flavored water. I was hoping for something like kool-ade, and did not get that with this product. The amount of sweetness it gives is ok, I just wish the fruity flavor was a lot more intense."
negative,"I really hoped that this would be good for milk and yogurt like Quik or Hersheys syrup, but sadly, it is not.<br /> Being a newly minted diabetic, I am<br />very limited on things I can have, that of course, I used to love.<br />Like Strawberry Ice Cream, or a Strawberry shake. I had hope that this product<br />with Stevia would be a good alternative.<br />I am afraid however that this stuff tastes nothing like strawberry at all, frankly I am not sure what it<br />tastes like.<br /><br />I ordered this after I had purchased their Chocolate product, which is AMAZING.<br />I loved it so much I had just assumed the strawberry would be<br />just as good, so much so I had bought 2 containers of it.<br /> Well, you live and you learn. Will I buy it again? not a chance. Will I buy the Chocolate<br />stevita again? darn right I will.<br />That stuff tastes great in skim milk, and that greek zero fat yogurt ( which I can have ) and makes that stuff taste<br />fantastic.<br /><br />So. Strawberry Sevita NO.<br />Chocolate Sevita YES YES YES.<br /><br />As usual, taste is an personal thing, and you might like the strawberry stuff, so Your Milage May Vary."
negative,"I will start by saying I love stevia! I have used it for years in just about every form there is (powder, liquid, packets, teas, etc) so I do understand it's taste and concentration. Unfortunately, this stuff just taste nasty no matter how you mix it! I've tried using less, I've tried using more, nothing helps. So far, I have only tried the strawberry so I'm hoping other flavors are better, but this one is just not drinkable, sorry."
negative,"Do they test their product before selling it? This wont dissolve, it lumps up into chunks on top. Total waste of money."
positive,"This Hot and Sour soup is excellent! We like to enhance it some with a little extra spice (habanero powder), some firm tofu, chinese dried black mushrooms, egg and scallions."
positive,"I love this soup, I used to be able to buy it at Walmart and then they discontinued selling it. So thanks to Amazon I can still get my soup."
positive,"After buying this product for under $1.50 each, I cannot see paying that price. It's a good soup mix ,,,But not $3.41 good."
negative,"I am spoiled because I caught, marinated, smoked and packaged my own salmon in the NW for years. I ordered the small packages for stocking stuffers for the holidays. I live in Louisiana (although salmon do not migrate to the Gulf) these days but salmon can be purchased semi-fresh all season. Should have bought some fillets and smoked them myself. I do know why it so overpriced it is a very easy process and never had a bad batch.<br />This Alaska salmon I purchased is (without going into details) would make a nice pet treat or crab bait after sampling it...I would not give it as a gift. Nice, authentic style packaging...gives you a star. But I trust Amazon, however I do not believe it was sampled by anyone in QA.<br /><br />Jim Kansier<br />New Iberia, LA"
positive,"I first saw this coffee at Amazon. I had never heard of Cameron's and this particular flavor sounded good. The aroma of the beans is wonderful. The aroma while brewing awakens me clear in the bedroom as its' set using the built in timer. My first cup and that was it ! Although I still like a strong dark French roast, this medium roasted Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan is now my favorite brew. The Aroma and Flavor is GREAT ! I would like to try some other roast by Cameron's, but I can't seem to make a change since I like this soooo much ! Really good coffee ! I highly recommend !<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESMUYK"">Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>"
negative,"Too mild and I'm not sure that it tastes of pecans at all.  We ended up mixing with stronger dark beans to give it some heft, but that doesn't make me want this again.  The price is good (esp given the rising price of coffee beans), but we won't re-order this one."
positive,"This coffee is fantastic and each cup makes me craving for more. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars - the smell is much less when the coffee is ready, the beans themselves smell much stronger and better. But over all it is pure pleaser and I am now a returning customer. We live in the Dominican Republic and when I first have ordered this coffee beans, my husband was very irritated, said - we live in the coffee republic, to order coffee via Internet is equal as to try selling snow to Greenland. But now he is the first one, who reminds me that our coffee stock is coming to an end and we need to order some more."
positive,I don't like flavored coffee that has a strong taste.  This is extremely good with a mild pecan taste and a great smell.
positive,"This coffee has enough real coffee taste to please real coffee drinkers and enough flavor to please those who only like flavors!  Simply put, one pot will please everyone in your house or at your party.  Great for every day or at a party; morning or dessert.  I love it and it is the only flavor I order now!  I am a bold/espresso drinker and my mom is a weak coffee drinker, but we can agree on this.  You won't be disappointed!"
negative,"I figured this coffee would be great from seeing the good reviews. I'm starting to think they are from the company. I was looking for a good southern pecan coffee and this tastes nothing like pecans. It tastes like hazelnut. If I wanted hazelnut, I would buy it. The coffee itself tastes okay, but it doesn't taste how it should. I expected better from this company since I love their other flavors."
negative,"I was unable to buy the particular brand of Southern Pecan coffee locally that I've bought for years so started researching on Amazon for a replacement.  Read the various customer reviews and this brand seemed to be the perfect choice.<br /><br />This is what I've found since purchasing it:  The coffee is very weak in flavor, watery in taste and........when you grind more coffee beans to compensate........it doesn't improve.  No creamy, rich flavor - not even close.<br /><br />For my money, I will never buy this coffee again.  It's just not worth it."
positive,"believe all the 5-star reviews, this broth is restaurant quality...I'm thinking some restaurants are using this broth???<br /><br />Make sure you buy all the additions (greens, beef slices, bean sprouts, hot peppers, siracha, hoison sauce, etc...)<br /><br />Only thing I would modify is to add more water.  It's a little salty for my taste.  Water it down.  So, one package suggests 2 gallons of water...I would add an additional gallon of water.  Or whatever you like to get it just right.<br /><br />But it is awesome, it's got the aroma of Pho, it's semi-oily at the top of the broth...I mean...good, good, good!!!"
positive,I have NEVER left a review for anything and have been buying stuff online for years. This soup base makes the most authentic and delicious pho! My family was amazed that it tasted exactly the same as our favorite restaurant. ****Use high quality beef-it makes all the difference!
positive,"My wife and I have been trying to make Pho like the ones at the Vietnamese restaurant but no sucess.  When comes to Pho, I am very, very picky on how it should taste.  I've gone to many restaurants and even some of their pho does not meet my expectation....only a few select restaurants actually does.  First time I found VV Foods' Pho base was in an asian store.  Unfortunately, they don't always have it in stock.  I guess someone else found out the ""secret"" base as well.  I called up VV Foods and they said that I can order directly through them or through Amazon.  Best Pho base ever.  Even if you can't cook, this pho base will make you a pro."
positive,I've been trying to make beef Pho at home for several months now with zero success. I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this. I read the reviews and ordered instantly.<br />It's so good. It's as good as our local restaurant. I followed some advice such as using less base so I made a gallon and used 4oz (5oz or half jar is what it calls for) or base and one spice packet. I let the spice packet boil for about an hour. I tasted it after the first boil as the instructions say but it didn't have as much flavor as I like.<br />My whole family loved it.<br />The only thing is I used rice stick noodles that weren't very good. I've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks. My local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size. Maybe I'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they didn't get as soft as I like.
positive,"Flavor of this broth was spot on!  I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants for this soup and the flavor was quite similar to this product.  My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I added an extra quart of water to dillute but it was still too salty.  Next time, I may use a bit less of the beef base.  I would definately recommend this product."
positive,"Yes! I don't have a pho restaurant anywhere near me.  This is the next best thing.  It truly has the pho flavor.  It comes with a jar of pho ""paste"" and two packets of seasoning.  I make two batches out of these and it makes a lot. I can also freeze any extra broth for later use.  I don't follow the directions regarding the onion and ginger.  I just simmer one seasoning packet for an hour to really pull out the spicy flavor, then I add half the paste mix.  Serve with the traditional pho ingredients.  YUM."
positive,"I fell in love with Pho on the east coast and when I moved to Texas one of the saddest moments was realizing there was no Vietnamese restaurant. I could not even get some of the spices in the recipes I found online. I tried five different times to make it from scratch, or from other Asian mixes, etc. and failed miserably.<br /><br />THIS IS IT! It's perfect. It tastes JUST LIKE the Pho at Pho Vung Tau... a perfect broth. JUST GREAT. With beef, chicken, or seafood, and romaine, sprouts, rice noodles plus fish, hoisin, limes and srichia (sp?) sauce, it's amazing!! I introduced this dish to my neighbors and Texas family and they're all Pho addicts now too. Especially fun with sweet fish dip and Chun's shrimp spring rolls. :) Can't say enough how great this stuff is if you love Pho and want to have it at home.<br /><br />Did I mention this is VERY YUMMY???? I wish I could post a picture to show how incredibly *pretty* this broth is when it's completed - such a rich color with a great sheen.<br /><br />A-plus!"
negative,"Altho this is a good pho base to make at home, however, the expiration is not visibly outside on the box but on the bottom of the jar inside the box.  I bought a couple of these from a local store and have been using them last week.  Just now I notice that they have expired three months ago.  I checked the box and see no dates so I made a call to VV Foods asking why expiration is not outside on the box instead.  The lady told me that the FDA's law that they have to have an expiration date stamped on the bottom or on the lid of the jar and not the outside packaging.  Also,  it's the store's responsibility to check and rotate the products.  She then educate me that consumers have the right to open the boxes to check on expiration dates and take back to store for refund if products expired.  Uh, each box contains 2 spice packages inside and for a customer to open the boxes up just to get a non-expired product would look very weird and even a waste of time.  And really made no sense at all.<br /><br />What if you buy from online because they're not available at local stores?  I don't think it would be a problem with Amazon to refund and/or resend but if it is Amazon's responsibility to open up the packaging to check for expiration dates before sending them to their customers would cause a problem in their shipping lines."
negative,"when i first received this product, i was psyched.<br />but after making the broth then i realized there's tons of<br />msg enbedded in the paste. we had to down tons of water afterwards.<br />i will not purchase or recommend this product to anyone who enjoys<br />a flavorful bowl of pho."
